Both neocortical and hippocampal networks organize the ﬁring
patterns of their neurons by prominent oscillations during sleep,
but the functional role of these rhythms is not well understood.
Here, we show a robust correlation of neuronal discharges be-
tween the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus on both slow
and ﬁne time scales in the mouse and rat. Neuronal bursts in deep
cortical layers, associated with sleep spindles and delta waves(cid:1)
slow rhythm, effectively triggered hippocampal discharges related
to fast (ripple) oscillations. We hypothesize that oscillation-medi-
ated temporal links coordinate speciﬁc information transfer be-
tween neocortical and hippocampal cell assemblies. Such a neo-
cortical– hippocampal
interplay may be important for memory
consolidation.

T he means by which ensembles of neurons interact with each

other for an effective transfer and storage of information are
not well understood. It is generally believed that network
oscillatory rhythms within and across structures support these
functions (1, 2). One current working hypothesis is that infor-
mation transfer at the hippocampal–neocortical interface in
sleep–wake cycle is involved in the encoding and consolidation
of memories (3–12). The oscillatory patterns in these structures
are fundamentally different in states of waking and sleep (13–
15). Attentive, exploratory behavior is characterized by neocor-
tical fast gamma activity and hippocampal theta(cid:1)gamma oscil-
lations (16–18). The most prominent hippocampal pattern
during slow wave sleep is a transient burst of CA3–CA1 pyra-
midal cells associated with a sharp wave in stratum (str.)
radiatum and fast field oscillation (140- to 200-Hz ripple) in the
CA1 pyramidal layer (19–21). Sleep patterns of the neocortex
include thalamocortical sleep spindles (12–18 Hz) and delta
waves (1–4 Hz) (13, 22). Whether and how these macroscopic
rhythms support the coding, transfer, and consolidation of
information is not understood.

Recently, it has been suggested that hippocampal ripples and
sleep spindles in the prefrontal cortex are temporally linked on
the scale of (cid:1)1 s (23). Whether neurons of the hippocampus
and neocortex are involved in a more specific spatiotemporal
interaction during sleep remains to be explored. To address
this issue, we used multisite recording of unit and field activity
in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. The somato-
sensory cortex was chosen because it is the most prominent
source of sensory information in the rat (24), and, unlike the
prefrontal cortex (25), it does not receive monosynaptic input
from the hippocampus. Here, we demonstrate temporal cou-
pling of neuronal activity between the somatosensory cortex
and hippocampus on both slow and fine time scales and show
that neocortical activity can time the occurrence of hippocam-
pal sharp waves and ripples. Such coupling may assist linking
neocortical and hippocampal cell assemblies during slow wave
sleep.

Materials and Methods
Ten male mice (six progeny of C57B6(cid:1)J and 129S6(cid:1)SvEvTac
hybrid mice and four connexin36 knockout; ref. 26; 30 – 40 g)
and four male Sprague–Dawley rats (300 – 400 g) were im-
planted with a microdrive that allowed the positioning of

recording electrodes in the somatosensory neocortex and(cid:1)or
the dorsal hippocampus. In mice, the electrodes were either
single wires (60-(cid:1)m diameter) or ‘‘tetrodes’’ (27, 28). Four rats
were equipped with single (n (cid:2) 2) or double (n (cid:2) 2) 16-site
silicon probes (with recording sites at 100-(cid:1)m vertical spacing)
for simultaneous recording of unit activity and field potentials
in different cortical layers and hippocampus. The position of
the electrodes was confirmed histologically. All procedures
conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and had been approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Rutgers.

Recordings were carried out in the home cage while the
animal was sleeping or immobile (1-Hz to 5-kHz frequency band;
20-kHz digitization rate). Data processing was done off-line.
Units were isolated by a semiautomatic cluster analysis program,
followed by manual adjustments using wave shape and cross(cid:1)
autocorrelogram information (27, 29). Local field potentials
were filtered for a particular frequency range by using contin-
uous wavelet transformation (30). Peaks of neocortical delta
waves and troughs of sleep spindles and hippocampal ripples
were detected as maxima(cid:1)minima of filtered signal that corre-
sponded to larger than 3 SD of the instantaneous log-power in
the same frequency band. In the case of delta waves, recorded
in deep layers (V–VI), detection of peaks was more reliable than
detection of troughs; therefore, peaks were used for quantitative
analyses. Spike–spike, spike–wave, and wave–wave time corre-
lations were assessed by cross-correlograms. Cross-correlograms
were normalized by the asymptotic mean firing rates of both
trains to obtain correlation index (c.i.). A c.i. of 1 corresponds to
independent firing, and a c.i. (cid:3)1 indicates correlated firing. To
investigate the temporal relationship between unit firing in
neocortex and hippocampus and times of peaks of network
oscillations, we used joint probability density of the lags between
unit firing in the two structures from the time of oscillation
peaks (31).

In rats, current source density (CSD) analysis (32) of the
simultaneously recorded field potentials was used to eliminate
volume conduction and localize actual depth of synaptic
currents. Space was assumed isotropic, and changes of resis-
tivity across layers were neglected. A 2D matrix of potentials
in space(cid:1)time was transformed into a CSD signal (33), using
a spatial differentiation scheme, that effectively smoothed
spatial noise. Spectral analyses were carried out by direct
multitaper estimates (34, 35) using five to nine tapers. Event-
triggered spectrograms were computed from electroencepha-
logram segments of 60 s centered on hippocampal ripples peak,
normalized by the mean spectrum over the entire session and
then log-transformed for visualization purposes (as shown in
Fig. 1b). To investigate the temporal relationship between
hippocampal ripples and neocortical delta and spindle events
on a slow time scale, cross-correlation between the respective
powers was computed in the following manner. Spectral power

Results
Slow Time Scale Analysis. The relationship between hippocampal
and neocortical local field and unit activity was studied in freely
moving mice and rats during periods of immobility and slow wave
sleep (Fig. 1a). To determine which neocortical network events
are temporally linked to hippocampal ripple activity, we first
examined average spectrograms of neocortical epochs centered
on CA1 ripples. Ripple occurrence was associated with a selec-
tive increase of power in the delta and sleep spindle bands (dark
red segments in Fig. 1b). The cooccurrence of the respective
neocortical and hippocampal events was modulated by slow and
ultraslow oscillations at 0.02–0.6 Hz observed previously in the
neocortex or hippocampus (Fig. 1b; refs. 12 and 36–39). To
quantify this slow time scale temporal relationship between
hippocampal and neocortical patterns at the group level, the
instantaneous power of hippocampal ripples was correlated with
that of neocortical sleep spindles (12–18 Hz) and delta (1–4 Hz)
waves. These analyses revealed a robust temporal relationship at
the 1- to 2-s time scale in both rats and mice (Fig. 1 c and d).
Similar relationships were observed in cross-correlograms be-
tween hippocampal ripple troughs or CA1 units and neocortical

unit activity (Fig. 1e). These findings confirm and extend pre-
vious observations on the rat (23, †).

Fine Time Scale Analysis. Cross-correlation of neocortical and CA1
hippocampal units, irrespective of the ongoing network patterns,
indicated that neocortical unit activity, on average, precedes
hippocampal discharges (Fig. 2a). Subsequent analysis, confined
to specific network patterns, revealed that the temporal asym-
metry of unit correlation was present during ripples, spindles,
and delta waves (Fig. 2 b–d). It should be noted that, although
for technical reasons we detected delta waves (layer V positive
wave of (cid:1)200 ms, associated with decreased or no unit activity),
many of the detected delta waves may formally reflect silent
periods of slow oscillations, described in cats and humans (13,
36, 40).

The fine time scale relationship between neocortical and
hippocampal activity was investigated further by taking advan-
tage of the established phase-locked discharges of neurons to
these respective field patterns. CA1 pyramidal cell discharge is
tightly locked to the troughs of hippocampal ripple waves (41),
and the troughs of sleep spindles and delta waves in deep cortical

layers reflect the maximum discharge of neocortical neurons
(13). Thus, troughs of field oscillations reflect synchronous
discharge of neurons throughout the network, compared with a
few locally recorded by the electrode. The peak discharge of
hippocampal neurons and the maximum probability of ripple
troughs occurred, on average, (cid:1)50 ms after the troughs of delta
waves (Fig. 3a). During neocortical sleep spindles, the peak
discharge of hippocampal neurons and the maximum probability
of ripple troughs occurred (cid:1)50 ms after (or (cid:1)20 ms before, in
the 12.5-Hz cycle) the trough of neocortical spindles (Fig. 3b).

CSD Analysis. Similar results were obtained in rats (n (cid:2) 4)
implanted with multiple-site silicon probes in the neocortex
(Fig. 4). We also exploited the advantage of silicon probes
and performed CSD analysis to eliminate spurious volume-
conducted field potential and to verify cortical origin of spindles
and delta waves. Neocortical deep sink-source pairs associated
with field spindles and unit activity were accompanied by
rhythmic phase-locking of CA1 unit activity (Fig. 4a). A similar
relationship was observed during delta waves. The deep-positive
peak of delta wave (source in layer V; Fig. 4b) was associated
with reduced unit activity in neocortex and hippocampus and
increased discharge during the troughs of delta waves in both
structures.

Asymmetry of unit–unit cross-correlations and consistent
phase-locking of hippocampal activity to the neocortical rhyth-
mic discharges suggested neocortical modulation of hippocam-
pal activity. To explore this possibility, we recorded with mul-
tiple-site silicon probes simultaneously in both structures.
Neocortical spindles were occasionally associated with rhythmic

sinks in stratum (str.) radiatum of CA3, which were phase-locked
to neocortical spindles (Fig. 5). These observations indicate that
neocortical activity can reach the hippocampus by way of the
entorhinal input. The excitability fluctuations within hippocam-
pal networks, associated with neocortical spindles, could trigger
sharp wave-associated ripples in the CA1 region as well (Fig. 5).
Cortical delta waves were also associated with a similar depth
profile of sinks in the hippocampal CSD (not shown).

Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that neocortical and hippocampal
activity is coupled on both long and short time scales during slow
wave sleep. Coactivation of neuronal networks at the suprasec-
ond time scale can be brought about by synchronization of
various ultraslow rhythms that these structures are intrinsically
endowed with (37–39) and(cid:1)or by common modulatory drive
(42). An important finding of our experiments is the presence of
a much finer temporal relationship between neocortical and
hippocampal neuronal activity. Superimposed on the ultraslow
comodulation of network patterns, neocortical bursts, associated
with delta(cid:1)slow oscillation and spindle rhythms, produced by
thalamocortical circuitry (13–15), entrained hippocampal neu-
rons at the 10-ms time scale and triggered population events
associated with ripples. On the basis of the latency differences

and CSD analyses, it is reasonable to assume that neocortical
events activated layer II and III entorhinal neurons (43), which,
in turn, induced an excitability bias within the hippocampal
networks. Although the emergence of sharp wave bursts does not
require extrahippocampal inputs (44), the present findings show
that the exact timing of sharp wave bursts can be influenced by
neocortical events during sleep.

For formal reasons, we related neocortical delta waves to
hippocampal patterns. However, a significant portion of the
delta waves was likely part of slow oscillations that are known to
modulate neocortical excitability (36, 45). The silence–activity
transition of cortical slow oscillation can trigger sleep spindles
(13), and the strong population synchrony associated with it
could also trigger hippocampal ripples. Within sleep spindles, a
fine temporal structure existed between neocortical and hip-
pocampal neurons. The excitability fluctuations of neocortical
neurons within the spindle effectively timed ripple occurrence in
the hippocampus. In turn, the hippocampal output during ripple
likely added further excitation to the next spindle cycle. Alter-
natively, both neocortical and hippocampal activity can be paced
by a common input (e.g., thalamus) during spindles.

The functional importance of the demonstrated coupling be-
tween neocortical and hippocampal network activity is that it
provides the temporal framework for coordinated information
transfer between the two structures. Particularly, we hypothesize
that neocortical neuronal discharges, associated with delta wave
and spindle events, ‘‘select’’ via the entorhinal input which hip-
pocampal neurons will participate in the triggered ripple events.

Individual sleep spindles emerge from the activity of different
thalamic and cortical neuronal assemblies, as evidenced by the
variable spatial distribution of spindle power in successive spin-

dle episodes (14). We suggest that these specific inputs can select
burst initiators of the hippocampal sharp wave events (46). In
turn, the sharp wave(cid:1)ripple-related discharge of neurons in the
CA3-CA1-subiculum-presubiculum-entorhinal cortex axis (21)
will provide a synchronous output preferably to those neocor-
tical cell assemblies that continue to participate in the spindle
event. Thus, the hippocampal output coexists with the postsyn-
aptic discharge of a specific group of neocortical pyramidal cells,
due to the long duration of sleep spindles and(cid:1)or delta(cid:1)slow

oscillations. The robust temporal relationship between cortical
rhythmic activity and hippocampal ripples suggests that coupling
of these network events is an effective mechanism to link neo-
cortical and hippocampal cell assemblies and strengthen their
coalition.
