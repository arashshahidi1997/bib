Ongoing network activity often manifests as irregular ﬂuctuations
in local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs), a complex mixture of multicellular
synaptic currents of varying locations and extensions. Among other
conditions, for synchronously ﬁring presynaptic units to generate
sizable postsynaptic LFPs, their axonal territories should overlap.
We have taken advantage of anatomical regularity of the rat hippo-
campus and combined multiple linear recordings and spatial dis-
crimination techniques to separate pathway-speciﬁc LFPs with
enough spatial resolution to discriminate postsynaptic regions of
varying activation, and to investigate their presynaptic origin,
chemical nature, and spatial extension. We identiﬁed 6 main excit-
atory and inhibitory LFP generators with different synaptic terri-
tories in principal cells and hippocampal subﬁelds matching
anatomical pathways. Some recognized pathways did not contribute
notably to LFPs. Each showed different septo-temporal spatial
modules over which the ﬁeld potential ﬂuctuations were synchro-
nous. These modules were explained by either the strong overlap of
synaptic territories of coactivated afferent neurons (e.g., CA3 clus-
ters for CA1 Schaffer LFPs), or widespread coalescence of postsyn-
aptic territories (granule cell somatic inhibition). We also show
evidence that distinct modes of afferent synchronization generate
stereotyped spatial patterns of synchronous LFPs in one pathway.
Thus, studying spatial coherence of pathway-speciﬁc LFPs provides
remote access to the dynamics of afferent populations.

Introduction
Correlated ﬁring of neurons is often associated with shared
synaptic inputs (Diesmann et al. 1999), which manifest as
ﬂuctuations of the local ﬁeld potential (LFP; Bach and Kruger
1986; Arieli et al. 1995). This mesoscopic variable is mostly
contributed by the postsynaptic currents (Purpura 1959; Elul
1972; Nunez and Srinivasan 2006), and as such LFP constitu-
tes a link between the ongoing activity of afferent populations
(distant and/or local) and the induced spatially distributed
ﬁring of postsynaptic neurons (Belitski et al. 2008; Fernández-
Ruiz, Makarov, Benito, et al. 2012).

It has long been hypothesized that spontaneous macro-
scopic ﬁeld potentials have a multifoci origin made up by the
group of currents injected in the extracellular space by syn-
chronously activated synapses, so called “elementary synaptic
units” (Elul 1972). Such groups of coactivated synapses are
located on multiple postsynaptic neurons according to axonal
branching and topology, making up multineuron sources of
complex geometry. Whereas the theoretical foundations de-
scribing how the spread of currents in a volume conductor

raise ﬁeld potentials of different magnitude and polarity are
long established (Lorente de Nó 1947; Woodbury 1960;
Plonsey 1969; Gloor 1985; Nunez and Srinivasan 2006), it was
soon recognized that the geometrical complexity of these
sources would be a handicap to decipher the cellular origins
of LFP ﬂuctuations. If axonal
territories of synchronously
ﬁring presynaptic units overlap in the target postsynaptic
region, the synaptic currents will have a chance to sum and
raise sizable LFPs. However, due to variation in the spatial
coverage of coactivated multineuron sources, the LFPs re-
corded at 2 nearby sites may be matched or different. The
spatial extension, amplitude, and polarity of LFPs are inﬂu-
enced by a combination of factors including the patterns of
synaptic territories of converging pathways, the topology of
connections, and the time-dependent mixture of synaptic cur-
rents. We take the advantage of regular cytoarchitecture of the
rat hippocampus, high-density recordings, and spatially dis-
criminating analysis techniques (Bell and Sejnowski 1995;
Choi et al. 2005) to address the pathway composition of
ongoing LFPs and the time-varying spatial coverage of each
component.

The hippocampus exhibits multiple naturally oscillating
ﬁeld potentials, including those displaying theta and gamma
patterns (Buzsáki et al. 1983). These oscillations probably
involve the synchronous activity of one or few synaptic path-
ways and have been widely used to study synaptic plasticity
and the neuronal correlates of behavior (Paulsen and Moser
1998; Traub et al. 1998; Reichinnek et al. 2010). However, the
physiological spectrum of ongoing LFPs contains a much
wider collection of “irregular” activities that have been poorly
studied and may provide valuable details as to the information
arriving from multiple afferent populations to hippocampal
principal neurons.

As it was demonstrated by the laminar analysis of evoked
potentials (Andersen et al. 1971), the stratiﬁcation of synaptic
inputs into the discrete domains of postsynaptic cells pro-
duces distinct laminar ﬁeld potential proﬁles upon activation
of each afferent pathway (laminar dipoles). The difference
between evoked and ongoing activities is in spatial extension
of the activated postsynaptic region, occupying entirely, or in
part, the synaptic territory of such input. We here asked
whether the large irregular LFPs in the hippocampus arise as
occasional spatiotemporal concurrence of synaptic currents
from multiple independent presynaptic origins or they contain
topographically determined modules of activity.
these
modules exist, they should be related to anatomical pathways.
Thus, we explored the existence of such spatial modules
for different pathway-speciﬁc inputs (here termed as LFP gen-
erators) during ongoing activity by analyzing multiple

simultaneous recordings of the target populations in 3 steps.
First, we determine all principal synaptic pathways that contrib-
ute to ongoing LFPs by separating their mixed contributions
using multiarray linear recordings and analytical techniques,
including independent component analysis (ICA; Makarov et al.
2010; Makarova et al. 2011). Secondly, we study their chemical
nature and the neuronal populations of origin using local
pharmacology and chemical manipulation of presynaptic
nuclei. Finally, we explore their spatial coherence by compar-
ing the time activations of each LFP generator in multiple sites
along the septo-temporal axis and checked their stability upon
different levels of presynaptic synchronization.

The results provide empirical evidence of

the varying
spatial extension of postsynaptic LFP generators brought
about by the variable synchronization of presynaptic units.
We found 6 main excitatory and inhibitory LFP generators in
different subﬁelds of the hippocampus, each corresponding
to the postsynaptic activity elicited in distinct synaptic terri-
tories of principal pyramidal or granule cells by speciﬁc local
and extrinsic afferent pathways. The septo-temporal extension
over which each LFP generator was synchronous varied con-
tinuously during ongoing irregular LFP activity, reﬂecting the
varying activation of presynaptic units with topographic pro-
jections. In some pathways such as the CA3 Schaffer input to
CA1, we recognized different spatial patterns of synchronous
postsynaptic activity that corresponded to stereotyped modes
of presynaptic ﬁring. Thus, the availability of spatial modules
of pathway-speciﬁc activity allows the recognizable modes of
functional organization to be identiﬁed in different segments
of hippocampal networks.

Materials and Methods

Experimental Procedures
All experiments were performed in accordance with European Union
guidelines (86/609/EU) and Spanish regulations (BOE 67/8509-12,
1988) regarding the use of laboratory animals, and the experimental
protocols were approved by the Research Committee of the Cajal In-
stitute. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with ur-
ethane (1.2 g/kg, intraperitoneally) and placed in a stereotaxic device.
Surgical and stereotaxic procedures were performed as described pre-
viously (Herreras et al. 1988; Canals et al. 2005). Concentric stimulat-
ing electrodes were placed in one or more of the following sites in
order to activate speciﬁc pathways and subﬁelds: Ipsilateral CA3
region, and medial and lateral perforant pathways. Multisite silicon
probes (Neuronexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) of 16 or 32 linear record-
ing sites organized in 1 or 2 shanks were used to record in multiple
tracks at steps of 50 or 100 μm parallel to the main axis of the CA1
pyramidal cell region, also spanning the dentate gyrus (DG)/CA3
regions. In experiments using multiple shanks, these were located
along the long axis of the dorsal portion of the hippocampus, roughly
parallel to the midline (AP, 4.5–6.5 and L, 2.6–3.5 mm). In a subset of
experiments, additional glass pipettes were used to simultaneously
record from multiple points at more lateral and ventral levels guided
by evoked potentials. Linear probes were soaked in 1,1′-dioctadecyl-
3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) before inser-
tion (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to assess their
placement in histological sections postmortem. A silver chloride wire
implanted in the skin of the neck served as a reference for recordings.
Signals were ampliﬁed and acquired using MultiChannel System (Reu-
tlingen, Germany), and Axon (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA) hardware and software were used for multisite and glass pipette
recordings (50 and 20 kHz sampling rate, respectively).

The excitatory/inhibitory chemical nature of LFP generators was
studied by the local application of neurotransmitter blockers via glass

recording pipettes (7–10 µm at the tip). These were introduced at a
10° angle from the vertical and targeted loci within 300–500 µm of
a linear probe at different strata of the CA1/DG subﬁelds. Microdrops
(50–100 pL) were pressure injected by a Picospritzer (General Valve,
Fairﬁeld, NJ, USA) and adjusted to limit drug effects to within 500 µm,
as determined by the selective modulation of evoked potentials in the
desired group of recording sites (Canals et al. 2005). Bicuculline
methiodide (BIC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or 6,7-dinitro-quinoline-
2,3-dione (DNQX; Tocris, Bristol, UK) were loaded into the pipettes to
block gamma amino butyric acid-A (GABA-A) and non-n-Methyl-D-
Aspartate (NMDA) Glu receptors, respectively. Drugs were dissolved
in artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid at concentrations of approximately
50 times higher than those usually employed in vitro. A single injec-
tion ensured stable effects of the drug for at least 60 s. In some exper-
iments requiring longer drug actions, successive microdrops were
injected at 5-min intervals, resulting in reasonable long-term stability
witnessed by the steady effect on evoked potentials. In one set of
experiments, BIC was injected from larger pipettes (10–12 µm at the
tip)
to achieve spatially extended hypersynchronous activity in
neuronal populations projecting to recording loci (i.e., the afferent
populations originating LFP components).

In a subset of experiments, recordings were obtained from awake
animals implanted with a multishank device (92 recording sites in
6 parallel
linear arrays). These data were obtained in the lab of
G. Buzsáki using procedures for animal handling, surgery, and record-
ing described previously (Montgomery et al. 2009).

At the end of each experiment, the animals were perfused through
the abdominal aorta with phosphate buffer saline containing heparin
(0.1%) followed by paraformaldehyde (4%), and the brains were
processed for microscopic inspection. Sagittal sections (80 µm) were
stained with bis-benzimide and examined by ﬂuorescence microscopy
for the assessment of the electrode positioning (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Independent Component and Current Source-Density Analyses
of LFPs
ICA is routinely used to elucidate functional connectivity either in
multisite scalp recordings or
in functional magnetic resonance
imaging, and it provides spatially stable components of coherent
activity (Makeig et al. 1997; Van de Ven et al. 2004; Congedo et al.
2010; Hutchison et al. 2010). While the attribution of these ICA com-
ponents to their source populations and pathways is difﬁcult when
recording from a distance, the in-source recording of intrahippocam-
pal LFPs allows the thorough spatial inspection of active neurons
down to the subcellular deﬁnition, and direct matching with the
evoked potential proﬁles (Korovaichuk et al. 2010).

Detailed procedures have been previously described (Makarov
et al. 2010; Fernández-Ruiz, Makarov, Benito, et al. 2012), and both
the mathematical validation and the interpretation of ICA components
in laminated structures were performed using realistic LFP modeling
(Makarova et al. 2011). Brieﬂy, M simultaneously recorded LFP
signals were represented as the weighted sum of the activities of N
neuronal sources or LFP generators:

umðtÞ ¼

XN

n¼1

VmnsnðtÞ;

where {Vmn} is the mixing matrix composed of the so-called voltage
loadings or spatial distributions of all LFP generators and sn(t), the
time course of the nth LFP generator. Thus, the raw LFP observed at
the kth electrode tip is a linear mixture of the electrical activity of
several
independent LFP generators describing transmembrane
current source densities (CSDs) in principal cells. Then, the CSD
loading for the nth LFP generator is given by In = −σΔVn, where σ is
the conductivity of the extracellular space (Makarov et al. 2010). As
the location of recording sites is known, the joint curve of spatial
weights of an LFP generator equals to instant depth proﬁles of pro-
portional voltage among sites, as during the laminar recording of
standard pathway-speciﬁc evoked potentials. To perform the ICA, we
employed the kernel density ICA algorithm (Chen 2006), which
returns the activations sn(t) and spatial weights Vn of up to N LFP

generators. Usually, few generators (4–7) exhibited signiﬁcant ampli-
tudes and distinct spatial distributions in the hippocampus (Korovai-
chuk et al. 2010). The spatial stability of LFP generators within and
across animals was estimated using the cluster analysis of spatial
curves as in Makarov et al. (2010) (Supplementary Fig. 2), whereas
their landmarks (e.g., maxima or zero crossings) were matched to
anatomical boundaries using electrophysiological correlates (unit
ﬁring at cell body layers and evoked potentials) and histological veri-
ﬁcation. The mixing matrix can be made with any number of simul-
taneous recordings, whether belonging to a single or multiple parallel
arrays. Although, in the latter case, sn(t) represents spatially averaged
activity, the combined spatial curve of weights is fully reliable and
was used to evaluate the relative power of a given LFP generator in
different hippocampal sites. The temporal accuracy of LFP generators
can be cross-checked by analyzing the same LFP epochs using differ-
ent number of contiguous electrodes (Supplementary Fig. 3). This
procedure also served to increase the relative variance of an LFP gen-
erator by discarding the recordings where other generators intro-
duced heavy variance, hence increasing the temporal accuracy by
minimizing cross-contamination (Makarova et al. 2011). Once ex-
tracted from the raw LFPs, each LFP generator can be analyzed inde-
pendently by reconstructing virtual LFPs produced by a single
generator, uj(t) = Vjsj(t) and then evaluating the current density
created by this generator, the spatial proﬁle of which allows compari-
son with proﬁles obtained during speciﬁc activation of known path-
ways (Makarova et al. 2011).

Current source-density analysis (Freeman and Nicholson 1975;
Rappelsberger et al. 1981) determines the magnitude and location of
transmembrane current generated by neuronal elements
the net
within a small
tissue. Accordingly, we used the
1-dimensional approach, which calculates the CSD from the voltage
gradients along the cells axis (Herreras 1990):

where h is the distance between recording sites. Admittedly, the
spatial extent of current sources may not be large enough to fulﬁll the
criterion of homogeneous activation in the XZ plane parallel to ana-
tomical strata or laminae during asynchronous synaptic bombard-
ment, thus tangential currents may introduce error in the amplitude
estimate of sinks and sources (Leung 1979). Conveniently, the spatial
distortion introduced by unbalanced tangential currents is effectively
canceled out by time averaging of myriads microscopic currents as if
they all were synchronously activated (Makarova et al. 2011). Thus,
the curve of spatial weights for each LFP generator is accurate to the
subcellular level. Although there is also a notable heterogeneity of
tissue resistivity at the level of the st. pyramidale (López-Aguado et al.
2001), it introduces a negligible spatial distortion of depth proﬁles
when active currents are located in distant dendritic loci. Thus, we
have assumed homogeneous resistivity and used arbitrary units
instead of CSD. In addition, we note that instant estimation of CSD
along the entire anatomy of a cell generator (e.g., the CA1 pyramidal
cell) does not render the balanced amount of inward and outward
currents, while the CSD of reconstructed virtual LFPs for separated
generators does (cf. in Fig. 1 of Fernández-Ruiz, Makarov, Benito,
et al. 2012). This is a valuable side effect of the ICA when applied to
laminar proﬁles covering the entire anatomy of cell generators: The
separated components necessarily contain spatially coherent activity
at any instant. Thus, for “in-source” recordings, the ICA acts as a rejec-
tion device for volume-conducted currents (Makarov et al. 2010; these
may, however, come up in other ICA components). Consequently, the
second spatial derivative of the curve of spatial weights of LFP com-
ponents extracted for ongoing activity matches to that of the CSD,
which was veriﬁed for excitatory pathways using the corresponding
evoked potentials (Korovaichuk et al. 2010).

(t) is the virtual LFP at the electrode with maximal power and H, the
appropriately scaled square kernel of the length Δ. The mean power
is then deﬁned for Δ extended to the complete time interval (∼10 min
in our experiments).

The spatial extent of LFP generators was determined by estimating
the cross-correlation index of the time envelopes or activations (10
min epochs) obtained for each LFP generator in different recording
shanks (simultaneous recordings). We applied an ICA separately over
each shank and then evaluated the pairwise cross-correlation index
over time activations of the same LFP generator in different shanks.

The macroscopic spatial boundaries of each LFP generator across
the hippocampal subﬁelds were visualized by contour plots that built
from the spatial curves of LFP generators separated through a joint
analysis of all 96 simultaneous recordings arranged in 6 parallel linear
shanks, that is, using a single loading matrix with all recordings that
rendered a unique set of LFP generators. In this case, the unique time
activation obtained for each generator is averaged over large exten-
sions and, thus, it may not reﬂect local activity, although this was irre-
levant when determining the spatial distributions. Faulty recording
sites can be eliminated without signiﬁcant performance loss of the
ICA.

In a subset of experiments, the dynamic changes in the spatial
extent of the LFP generators were examined by comparing the ﬁne
temporal details (activity) of a single generator in up to 4 different
locations. For simplicity, we chose the excitatory Schaffer input from
CA3 to CA1 that we had previously analyzed in depth (Fernández-
Ruiz, Makarov, Benito, et al. 2012; Fernández-Ruiz, Makarov, Herreras
2012). The baseline activity of this generator is composed of a series
of discrete ﬁeld events or micro-ﬁeld excitatory postsynaptic potentials
(µ-fEPSPs). These are rhythmic excitatory packages in the gamma fre-
quency that can be retrieved and quantiﬁed. We used the Wavelet
Transform of v(t):

where ψ is the Haar mother wavelet (well suited for the detection of

equation:

The 2-dimensional (2D) surface obtained (Supplementary Fig. 4) de-
scribes the local linear ﬁt of the Schaffer-speciﬁc LFP by the pulse-like
function (Haar) at scale a and localization b. Large absolute values of C
(a,b) at a given time instant and scale correspond to abrupt pulse-like
transitions in v(t). Thus, we can associate such points in the (b,a)-plane
with singular LFP events. Consequently, the local maxima of C(a,b)

We next cross-correlated the µ-fEPSPs separately obtained in 2
locations and deﬁned matching quanta for a time-window of ±2 ms

ent shanks were further plotted and cross-correlated evaluating the

series from the original signals. For each experiment, we generated
1000 surrogates, and we evaluated spectral coherence. The signiﬁ-
cance level (at α = 0.05) was then calculated for each frequency value
and coherence above this level was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results

Subcellular and Regional Extension of Main
Hippocampal LFP Generators
To answer the generic question of why LFPs recorded nearby
match or differ we need to know which anatomical pathways
make synaptic contact near recording points, when each one
becomes active, and the geometry of the current sources. Con-
veniently, several anatomical pathways arrive in stratiﬁed
domains of principal cells, and their activation produces
spatially stable synaptic currents and potentials that are
pathway speciﬁc (Andersen et al. 1971; Leung 1979; Herreras
1990; Golarai and Sutula 1996), producing laminar spatial dis-
tribution of ongoing LFPs. These can be isolated by spatially
discriminating techniques. Figure 1 illustrates the problem
under study and the methodological approach. LFPs were re-
corded simultaneously along 2 parallel tracks spanning the
CA1 and DG of the dorsal hippocampus (16 recording sites
each, 100 µm apart, 500 µm between shanks). Recording sites
within a linear array parallel to the main axis of principal pyr-
amidal or granule cells explore different domains of nearby
neurons. Recordings sites in different arrays serve to explore
the multicellular (longitudinal) coverage of inputs by compar-
ing recordings at similar dendritic levels. LFPs recorded in
nearby electrodes may be very similar or differ signiﬁcantly

(Fig. 1A). In the illustrated example, while LFPs in the middle
of the st. radiatum are nearly identical within and among
arrays, those near the hippocampal ﬁssure (hf ) differ both in
the vertical direction (i.e. different dendritic domains of
nearby neurons), and in the horizontal plane (i.e. produced at
the same dendritic level of multiple neurons in distant sites).
Thus, the mixture of synaptic currents may already be hinted
more complex and spatially restricted in some regions and
neuron domains than in the others.

By inspecting multiple contiguous sites, bouts of activity of
variable duration in stable spatial bands can be appreciated
by the naked eye (Fig. 1B, boxed fragments). The stability of
the group of electrodes showing similar activity indicates
stable dendritic sites of synaptic activation by homogeneous
afferent populations in accordance with anatomical data
(Lorente de Nó 1934; Hjorth-Simonsen 1973). However, these
bouts are usually overlapping in time and also in space,
making unfeasible to ascribe LFP ﬂuctuations to postsynaptic
currents generated in one or another dendritic band. The site-
speciﬁc LFP activities can be disentangled by the ICA into
spatially stable independent LFP components or generators
(Makarov et al. 2010; Korovaichuk et al. 2010; Makarova et al.
2011; Fernández-Ruiz, Makarov, Benito,
al. 2012;
Fernández-Ruiz, Makarov, Herreras 2012; see Materials and
Methods). The effectiveness of spatial separation can be
appreciated by comparing the time courses of the raw LFPs
with the activity of the ﬁrst 3 LFP generators (Fig. 1B vs. C).
Note that LFP ﬂuctuations in the same group of electrodes at
different moments were captured in the same LFP generator.
Importantly, different procedures can prioritize either the
spatial or temporal accuracy for speciﬁc components (see

Figure 1. Hippocampal LFPs present laminar distribution and their multiple sources can be separated in domain-speciﬁc synaptic components. (A) Sketch of linear parallel 2 × 16
arrays spanning the CA1 and DG subﬁelds, and examples of fragments of raw LFPs recorded in nearby positions (black or gray coding indicates the electrode positions and
corresponding traces). LFPs can match or differ signiﬁcantly at different positions and time points. The degree of similarity varies along the same vertical track (top panel) and
within the same dendritic domain (bottom panel). For example, recordings from the CA1 stratum radiatum are strongly correlated in contiguous electrodes of the same array and
between arrays, while signiﬁcant differences are observed near the hf in both vertical and horizontal directions. Thus, the mixture of synaptic currents appears to be more complex
and spatially restricted in some regions and neuronal domains than in others. (B) Representative recording of ongoing LFPs. Inset shows the location of the electrode array. Some
bouts of activity spanning different groups of contiguous electrodes are shown in boxes to facilitate visual inspection. The spatial stability observed in the groups of electrodes
with correlated activity indicates stable dendritic domains of the ongoing synaptic current sources. (C) Activity of 3 LFP generators separated by ICA from the LFP fragment shown
in B. The effectiveness of the separated generators can be appreciated by visual comparison of the boxed bouts with their corresponding LFPs in B. If bouts in different generators
overlap, then LFPs represent their weighted sum.

Materials and Methods), while the biophysical bases and limit-
ations of the ICA when analyzing hippocampal LFPs have
been thoroughly described elsewhere (Makarov et al. 2010;
Makarova et al. 2011).
We ﬁrst set out

to deﬁne all primary stable dendritic
domains of laminar LFPs. Except when indicated all results
refer to anesthetized animals. We always chose epochs of irre-
gular (nontheta) LFP activity for analysis as they contain a
more balanced contribution of different synaptic inputs than
macroscopic rhythms, in which one or few pathways may
take most variance. We showed earlier that dominance of one
input over others raises laminar LFPs that require additional
signal handling as it reduces ICA performance on the weaker
generators (Makarova et al. 2011).

We detected 6 main LFP generators that contained >99% of
total variance in CA1/DG proﬁles and were stable in both an-
esthetized and awake animals (Figs 2 and 3). Gross classiﬁ-
cation was achieved by the cluster analysis of their curves of
spatial weight obtained in 4–6 segments of 1 min in each
animal (128–192 LFP components/animal; n = 29 animals in
all experimental series; Methods and Supplementary Fig. 2).
Only the generators that exhibited relative variance >1% in
the complete CA1/DG (or CA1/CA3) proﬁles were examined,
and the smaller generators that were detected but which ex-
hibited very small or occasional activity were excluded from
the analysis. Figure 2A shows raw LFPs along the axis of prin-
cipal cells and the corresponding CSD proﬁles from a sample
experiment. When generator-speciﬁc LFP (virtual) proﬁles
were reconstructed (see Materials and Methods), each pre-
sented maximum activity in distinct dendritic domains of prin-
cipal cells (4 sample generators are shown in Fig. 2A) and
displayed only 1 maximum in a smooth spatial conﬁguration.
The LFP generators, G1 and G2, exhibited maximum power
in the st. radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare (LM) of the
CA1, respectively, although G2 also extended across the hip-
pocampal ﬁssure into the upper blade of the DG. Three more
LFP generators (G3–G5) were located in the DG and their
activity was strongest in the hilar region. Finally, an additional
generator (G6) exhibited maximum variance in and around
the CA3 pyramidal layer. Of all these generators the strongest
were those located around the hippocampal ﬁssure and
dentate hilus (see population data for the relative variance
and absolute power in Table 1).

The subcellular domains of each LFP generator can be ap-
proached by alignment of their respective spatial distributions
to additional electrical landmarks, such as, for example, the
population spikes in cell body layers. However, as LFPs
extend beyond their current sources through volume conduc-
tion (Lorente de Nó 1947), we reﬁned the subcellular location
of active membranes by the CSD analysis of the depth proﬁles
of LFPs that minimize the contribution of distant currents to
recorded ﬁeld potentials. This technique returns a spatial map
of the transmembrane currents along the main axis of princi-
pal cells, which for the activation of a single pathway pro-
duces the laminated distribution of balanced inward (sinks)
and outward currents (sources) circumscribed to the anatomy
of the cell generator (Freeman and Nicholson 1975; Herreras
1990; see Materials and Methods). Due to the coactivation of
multiple pathways, applying CSD to raw LFPs rendered an
intricate mixture of currents (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the CSD ob-
tained from the reconstructed generator-speciﬁc virtual LFPs
(see Materials and Methods) rendered clean spatial maps with

termination zones of stratiﬁed synaptic pathways in discrete domains of principal cells.
(A) Representative example of raw LFPs in a single electrode 1 × 32 array (left) and the
corresponding CSD proﬁle (right). The track spans from the CA1 soma layer to the inferior
GC soma layer (pyramidal and granule cell dummies are represented to the left for spatial
reference). Current sources are shown in red/yellow and sinks in blue. hf: hippocampal
ﬁssure. (B) Virtual LFP proﬁles and corresponding spatial weights reconstructed from
ICA-separated LFP generators extend through discrete bands or strata with precise
subcellular localizations. The CSD for each generator is restricted to a single cellular
generator (CA1 or CA3 pyramidal cells, or granule cells). Except in one case (G2, in the
CA1 st. lacunosum-moleculare; LM), all generators presented ﬁnite bands of inward or
outward currents (no alternation in time) and smooth spatial proﬁles with only one
maximum. Virtual CSD maps were obtained from virtual LFPs, and CSD weights (more
noisy) are second spatial derivative of voltage weight curves. Hatched areas denote the
dendritic bands where active (synaptic) currents were localized by local pharmacology
(Fig. 4). CSD scale is in nonproportional arbitrary units to facilitate the visualization of
weak currents. (C) Electric stimulation of major excitatory pathways produced evoked
ﬁeld EPSPs whose activity was selectively captured by the temporal activations of the
respective LFP generators (scaled in proportional arbitrary units). Sch, medial perforant

respectively. GCsom: granule cell soma generator.

location of the recording shanks in hippocampal subﬁelds (faulty electrodes are marked in red). (B) Representation of unfolded hippocampal subﬁelds showing the spatial
reconstruction of the relative weights corresponding to each isolated LFP generator. Note the repetitive spatial patterns and gradual shift of landmarks, such as the maxima or
zero crossings, that remain at equivalent dendritic levels following the natural curvature of hippocampal layers. Black arrows indicate volume-conducted activity introduced in one
subﬁeld (CA1 or DG) by generators with active synaptic currents in distal dendritic domains of the other (LM, LPP). Generators with active currents in nondistal portions, such as
the GCsom and MPP in the DG, generate little activity in remote areas (asterisks in CA1). Similar spatial proﬁles of some generators (GCsom and MPP) are efﬁciently discriminated
by the abrupt shift in the spatial demarcation of the corresponding maxima (arrowhead) in the molecular layer of the DG. (C) Two-dimensional representation of virtual
pathway-speciﬁc LFPs in hippocampal subﬁelds indicating regional coverage, relative strength, and polarity (except for the LM generator in which polarity is unreliable). The active
synaptic currents (identiﬁed by local pharmacology, see next ﬁgure) are deﬁned by yellow or white lines, and the small squares indicate the zones of poor deﬁnition due to faulty
electrodes.

characteristic smooth and simple laminar distributions of cur-
rents circumscribed to either the CA1 pyramidal cells (G1 and
G2), granule cells (G3–G5), or CA3 pyramidal cells (G6). The
hatched areas in the curves of spatial weights for the CSD indi-
cate the active synaptic zones as determined by local pharma-
cology (Fig. 2B, see below). LFP generators in the DG were
duplicated in both the upper and lower blades with a mirrored
spatial distribution, and they exhibited no current in the hilus
(except for errors created by spatial smoothing of discrete re-
cording points). These spatial proﬁles were consistent with
standard potential and CSD proﬁles of evoked synaptic acti-
vation in granule cells (McNaughton 1980; Golarai and Sutula
1996; Canning and Leung 1997; Korovaichuk et al. 2010). The
so-called Schaffer generator (G1), with a characteristic spatial
pattern of excitatory current sinks in the st. radiatum, was pre-
viously identiﬁed as the excitatory input from CA3 to CA1

(Korovaichuk et al. 2010; Fernández-Ruiz, Makarov, Benito,
et al. 2012). The other CA1 LFP generator (G2 or LM genera-
tor), which extended across the hippocampal ﬁssure, exhib-
ited a temporal succession of current sinks and sources
restricted to the st. LM. All 3 DG generators presented current
sources in both granule cell layers and sinks in the corre-
sponding molecular layers, albeit with distinct intensities and
subcellular distribution. Thus, G3 (termed as GCsom generator)
had strong sources in the granule cell layer, while G4 and G5
were characterized by strong narrow sinks in the medial and
outer third of the molecular layer, respectively, and they were
identiﬁed as the excitatory medial and lateral perforant path
inputs to granule cells (medial perforant pathway [MPP] and
lateral perforant pathway [LPP] generators; see distinct spatial
curves in Fig. 3A) through the selective activation of the
medial and lateral portions of the angular bundle, respectively
(Fig. 2C). The LFP generator G6 was associated with strong
current sources in the soma layer of CA3, and it was sur-
rounded by sinks in both dendritic trees.

Next, we examined the regional extension of LFP genera-
tors. If LFP generators represent postsynaptic activity elicited
by activity in distinct afferent populations, then each should
exhibit regionalization in hippocampal subﬁelds consistent
with the spatial pattern of the axonal termination of that
population. Therefore, we investigated the regional extension
of the LFP generators in 2 awake animals in which multiarray
electrodes were implanted (6 parallel shanks separated by
500 µm, Fig. 3A), and in 4 additional animals using single-
in anesthetized
array electrodes, plus numerous
animals. In awake animals, we analyzed recordings obtained

during nontheta behaviors (while still alert, as well as during
consummatory tasks and slow-wave sleep), and spatially
stable LFP generators across 6-shank arrays (Fig. 3A) were ob-
tained by building a single matrix for analysis covering differ-
ent dendritic levels and hippocampal subﬁelds (77 of 96
useful channels in the experiment of Fig. 3). Analysis of the
multiple segments of LFPs revealed identical sets of main gen-
erators to those found in multiple recording tracks in anesthe-
tized animals. By representing the relative weights at each
recording site we obtained combined spatial curves for all the
arrays that revealed distinct spatial patterns ﬁtting the anatom-
ical boundaries of the hippocampal subﬁelds. Each generator
featured landmarks such as maxima and zero crossings that
gradually shifted within the recording sites in parallel arrays
matching the curved anatomy of the hippocampus such that
they coincided at the same dendritic level (Fig. 3B, and see
the 2D spatial conﬁguration of the LFP generators illustrated
in Fig. 3C). Note that LM and LPP generators whose active sy-
naptic domains are located in the distal dendrites of CA1 pyr-
amidal and granule cells, respectively, entered notable ﬁeld
potential into the adjacent subﬁeld by volume conduction
(Fig. 3B, black arrows), while this was not observed for MPP
and GCsom generators (asterisks). It was also notable that
there were dominant positive ﬁeld potentials in the DG gen-
erators in the hilus generated through the volume conduction
of currents from granule cell membranes. Despite the appar-
ent similarity between MPP, LPP, and GCsom generators, these
were readily discriminated by a persistent spatial shift in their
the st. moleculare-granule cell
respective distributions at
border (e.g., arrowheads in r3, Fig. 3B; see additional evi-
dence below).

Excitatory and Inhibitory LFP Generators
Using selective stimulation of principal extrinsic and associa-
tional pathways, we previously obtained data supporting the
presynaptic origin of some excitatory LFP generators (Koro-
vaichuk et al. 2010; see also Fig. 2C). Further evidence of the
excitatory/inhibitory nature of all LFP generators was
achieved by a local blockade of non-NMDA or GABA-A synap-
tic receptors using DNQX and BIC, respectively. As both
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs produce the loops of
transmembrane currents with clearly discernible subcellular
inward (sinks) and outward (sources) domains, we searched
for the active bands (the site of synaptic contacts) by pharma-
cologically targeting each input. This was achieved by releas-
ing a microdrop (50 nL) containing DNQX (1 mM) and DiI
(4%) in the vicinity of the caudal shank of a 2-shank probe at
the level of the CA1 st. radiatum (Fig. 4A). The Glu-R blocker
selectively reduced the Schaffer-evoked fEPSP in the caudal
shank, whereas no effects were observed on the rostral shank
located 500 µm away, in concordance with the extension of
the dye. The spatially localized effect of the drug can be also
appreciated in the curves of the spatial weights that reﬂect a
selective decrease of variance at the Schaffer terminal zone in
the group of electrodes associated with the caudal shank.
Moreover, DNQX only reduced Schaffer-evoked fEPSPs and
ongoing Sch-LFPs when administered in the st. radiatum, but
not in the soma layer or st. oriens (Supplementary Fig. 6).
This procedure allows the synaptic areas and chemical nature
of all 6 LFP generators to be identiﬁed.

1744 Spatial Modules of Activity of LFP Generators

(cid:129) Benito et al.

Accordingly, the mean power for each virtual LFP was esti-
mated over 200-s segments before and after drug adminis-
tration in the following regions: The CA1 st. radiatum and
lac.-mol for the Sch and LM generators, respectively;
the
st. moleculare of the DG for the MPP and LPP generators, the
granule cell layer for the GCsom generator, and the CA3 pyra-
midal cell
layer for the CA3 generator (see representative
results and the population data for the effective sites in
Fig. 4B,C, respectively). DNQX dramatically dampened the
activity of the Sch, MPP, and LPP generators (29.2 ± 9.9%;
15.7 ± 6.5%; 7.5 ± 3.0%; P < 0.01, Student’s t-test), whereas the
LM, GCsom, and CA3som generators were affected by both BIC
and DNQX, although a signiﬁcant decrease in the GCsom gen-
erator was only observed in response to DNQX (n = 4,
**P < 0.01, Student’s t-test: Fig. 4C). While the antagonistic
effect of BIC indicates a GABAergic origin, the reduction in
power observed in the same LFP generator following Glu-R
blockade indicates either a combination of 2 synaptic LFP
generators (1 excitatory and 1 inhibitory), or a reduction in
the excitatory drive of a single inhibitory pathway from local
interneurons with somatodendritic bodies and axonal projec-
tions in the same spatial domain. The narrow domains of the
active synaptic (outwards) currents produced by LM and
GCsom generators are suggestive of inputs from subpopu-
lations of interneurons with axon terminals at distal apical
dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells and granule cell somata,
respectively.

Minimum Spatial Modules of Correlation for
Pathway-Speciﬁc LFPs
The spatial correlation of LFPs (Fig. 1B) indicates the simi-
larity of the time envelopes of postsynaptic currents at distinct
loci. We ﬁrst sought evidence of anatomical determinants that
might underlie the spatial correlation by searching for the
minimum modules in which pathway-speciﬁc LFPs remain in-
variant. For this purpose, we recorded LFPs simultaneously
using 2 double-shank probes that were relocated in successive
sessions (Fig. 5A). We then estimated the mean correlation
coefﬁcient between the temporal envelopes of the same LFP
generator (1 min epochs) measured separately at different
locations in a rostro-caudal gradient. For this purpose, we
analyzed 2 excitatory (Sch and MPP) and 2 inhibitory (LM and
GCsom) LFP generators.

As expected, the spatial correlation of all LFP generators di-
minished over distance, although at marked generator-speciﬁc
rates. Superimposed fragments following GCsom activation
(Fig. 5B) show a close correlation, even for distant
loci
( points 1 vs. 6), which contrasted with the strong divergence
evident for the MPP generator ( points 3 vs. 4), even at short
distances (see the population data in Fig. 5C, n = 3–10
animals). At a distance of 1 mm, a strong spatial correlation
was observed for the inhibitory LFP generators in both the
CA1 (LM) and DG (GCsom), with a mean correlation of
0.6 ± 0.01 (n = 4) and 0.8 ± 0.01 (n = 4), respectively. A very
strong correlation was maintained for the excitatory Sch gen-
erator at distances of up to 1.5 mm (0.75 ± 0.1, n = 5: Exclud-
ing sharp-wave (SPW) events, the correlation never fell <0.9),
and this decayed gradually as the distances augmented. In
contrast, a strong correlation was only observed for the MPP
generator at 200 µm (0.89 ± 0.1; n = 4), which fell abruptly at
distances ≥500 µm (0.33 ± 0.1; n = 7).

The decay rate of the spatial correlation for the 4 selected

hippocampal curvature complicates the correct placement of
the arrays in central and ventral positions, we could obtain
long-distance correlations for the Sch generator by using

limited band in the st. radiatum in which we assessed that
Sch-LFPs are poorly contaminated by distal LM sources (Sup-
plementary Fig. 7). Thus, raw LFPs in these Schaffer-speciﬁc
sites (Fig. 5A, right) were correlated with the time activation
of the Sch generator in dorsal arrays (Fig. 5D, right). The cor-
relation fell <0.2 for distances >2 mm and approached zero
over longer distances, suggesting the existence of separate
groups of activating presynaptic cells in the CA3 population.

In a separate set of experiments, we checked for the poss-
ible inﬂuence of diverse geometry and orientation of axonal
terminal ﬁelds (Ishizuka et al. 1990; Somogyi and Klausberger
2005) by rotating 2-shank probes respect
to the midline
(Fig. 5E1). At least for the short distance tested (0.5 mm
between shanks), we found identical high and low correlation
for both the Sch (Fig. 5E, right, black circles) and MPP gen-
erators (gray circles), respectively (n = 3 animals).

Globally, these results indicate pathway-speciﬁc structural
(anatomical) modules of invariant LFPs, which are largest for
the granule cell somatic inhibitory input, very small for the
excitatory MPP generator, and very large for the excitatory
Schaffer generator only within strips parallel to the midline
but decaying gradually along the longitudinal axis of the
hippocampus.

The Match/Mismatch of Activity in LFP Generators
Reveals Speciﬁc Topology and the Dynamics of
Afferent Populations
A spatial module of correlated LFPs may be created by the
synchronous ﬁring of presynaptic units whose synaptic terri-
tories overlap heavily, or by joint modulation of the ﬁring rate
of presynaptic units whose projections do not necessarily
overlap. We studied both these possibilities in the 2 LFP gen-
erators exhibiting large modules of strong spatial correlation,
the excitatory Sch input to CA1, and the inhibitory GCsom
input to DG, comparing the ﬁne temporal structure of the
ﬂuctuations of each generator in site pairs (Fig. 6A1).

Time envelopes, estimated as instant variations in power,
exhibited near identical patterns for the Schaffer generator at
any 2 sites parallel to the midline (Fig. 6A2, points 1–2: Corre-
lation 0.93 ± 0.02, positions 4–4.5 mm posterior to bregma,
n = 7 measurements in 4 animals), and this correlation only
dropped signiﬁcantly when distant sites were compared in
which one of the recordings was near the subicular border
( points 1–6: 0.35 ± 0.07; n = 4). This decrease was induced
largely by the dissimilar spatial coverage of SPWs occurring at
low rates in periods of irregular nontheta activity (common
and site-speciﬁc SPWs are indicated with ﬁlled and empty tri-
angles and arrows, respectively: Fig. 6A2, see the sample
cluster of SPWs in Fig. 6A3). Cross-correlation between Schaf-
fer activations in dorso-medial ( points 2–3) and latero-ventral
positions ( points 7–8) fell to negligible values, irrespective of
the SPWs (0.13 ± 0.02, n = 6 comparisons in 2 animals: sample
in Fig. 6A2, points 3 and 8), indicating that different groups
of presynaptic CA3 cells project to laterally shifted (i.e., septo-
temporal) CA1 sites.

Baseline Schaffer activity consisted of a gamma sequence
of discrete ﬁeld events in CA1 or µ-fEPSPs elicited by the
sequential ﬁring of CA3 neuronal assemblies (Fernández-Ruiz,
Makarov, Benito, et al. 2012; Fernández-Ruiz, Makarov, Her-
reras 2012). These excitatory quanta exhibited a steady rostro-
caudal delay of 2.0 ± 0.22 m/s (n = 9) that roughly approached

the conduction velocity of Schaffer collaterals measured by
evoked potentials (Andersen et al. 1971). In addition, there
was a strong covariation in the amplitude of elementary
µ-fEPSPs at sites parallel to the midline (Fig. 6B1), denoting a
common set of presynaptic units (or functional assembly) that
each generated a µ-fEPSP. The covariation index was esti-
mated by linear regression between paired series of µ-fEPSPs
independently obtained for each linear array and was
0.92 ± 0.3 between pairs of CA1 sites lying 4–6 mm posterior
to the bregma (see sample in Fig. 6A1,A2, n = 11 measure-
ments pooled from 4 animals), although it dropped to non-
signiﬁcant values as one of the recordings shifted laterally
and ventrally (r = 0.17 ± 0.02, n = 6 measurements pooled
from 3 animals; Fig. 6B3). The percentage of paired µ-fEPSPs
also dropped from 74.1 ± 3.1% to 46 ± 0.8% (∼20–30% of non-
paired events
see
Materials and Methods). Finally, we evaluated the spectral co-
herence between pairs of recordings taken at different dis-
tances within the spatially correlated modules (see Materials
and Methods). Analysis of 36 epochs (1 min each) in 4
animals rendered a smooth repeatable frequency proﬁle in
which the coherence was >0.8 for frequencies up to approxi-
mately 50 Hz and that decayed gradually to become nonsigni-
ﬁcant beyond approximately 100 Hz (Fig. 6C, upper row).

corresponded to noise-level events;

When the GCsom was compared with the Sch generator,
there were both similarities and notable differences within
their respective modules of coherence. Both exhibited a
dominant gamma succession of events (Figs 5B and 6B),
although the GCsom exhibited no signiﬁcant delay of paired
elementary events recorded in different sites (0.09 ± 0.11 ms;
n = 16 measurements pooled from 4 animals), indicating that
spike conduction through the axonal arborization of presyn-
aptic cells reached postsynaptic targets more synchronously.
Furthermore, despite the strong global correlation between
distant sites (up to 2.5 mm: Fig. 5C), the proﬁles of spectral
coherence for the GCsom generator were more irregular
between animals and varied in different epochs analyzed in
the same animal (Fig. 6C, Experiment 3). Thus, while the
spatial module of the coherence of the GCsom is compatible
with a joint modulation of the ﬁring rate of multiple presyn-
aptic units projecting over the granule cell population (Whit-
tington et al. 1995), the individual synaptic territories may not
overlap signiﬁcantly, permitting independent contributions to
local LFPs according to processing demands.

Varying Synchronization of Presynaptic Units also
Determines the Extent of Spatial Coherence
The aforementioned results indicate that anatomical con-
straints (e.g. overlapped postsynaptic territories of different
Schaffer axons) may determine spatial coherence over large
postsynaptic regions. However, naturally occurring variations
in the synchronization of presynaptic units also determine the
extent of spatial coherence. One such case is evident in the
spatial coverage of basal and SPW activities in the Schaffer
generator. Unlike elementary µ-fEPSPs, different SPW events
covered variable portions of the dorsal CA1 (Fig. 6A3).

To further test this issue, we devised a functional test to ex-
ternally modify the synchronization of ﬁring in the afferent
population/s. We checked 2 LFP generators with both high
and low spatial coherence, the Schaffer and MPP excitatory
generators, the activity of which is driven by the ipsilateral

Figure 6. The ﬁne temporal details within the modules of high spatial coherence indicate distinct mechanisms for the synchronous activation in different generators. (A) (1)
Schematic showing the insertion points (dorsal view) of parallel linear arrays. (2) Time envelopes of instant power (sliding window of 0.1 s) for the Schaffer generator in different
arrays, recording from loci parallel to the midline. Superimposed traces 1, 2 and 1, 6 belong to the same LFP epoch. The large bouts of activity correspond to SPWs. The spatial
coverage of SPWs varied signiﬁcantly, some reached the rostral end, while others did not (3). (B) Elementary µ-fEPSPs within the gamma frequency vary markedly within the
series, but maintained proportional amplitude along large strips parallel to the midline, indicating a common origin and local substrate. The rostro-caudal delay matches spike
conduction in Schaffer collaterals (vertical dashes indicate peak time and sequential activation). As recordings become more distant from one another (subplots 1–3), some of
the quanta begin to exhibit amplitude differences (arrows), while the time course of SPWs differs normally. Comparisons between rostro-medial and ventro-lateral activations (3)
are totally discrepant. The plots below show the amplitude covariation of paired quanta between arrays, where r is the cross-correlation coefﬁcient for the paired data. These
data indicate a heavy overlap of activated presynaptic axons as the substrate for the modules of high spatial coherence. (C) Comparative spectral coherence of 1 min epochs for
the Schaffer (upper row) and GCsom (lower row) generators between pairs of electrode arrays separated by 0.5 mm in different experiments and epochs. Gray shading indicates
the level of statistical signiﬁcance (surrogate test). The Schaffer generator exhibits similar spectral proﬁles in all and for similar frequency ranges, while the GCsom inhibitory
generator varied considerably even in different epochs of the same animal (t1 and t2 of Experiment 3). This discrepancy suggests the existence of different mechanisms
underlying the high spatial coherence.

degree of ongoing synchronous ﬁring in presynaptic units
was enhanced by GABA blockade via local BIC administration

through a recording pipette (Fig. 7A). Epileptic spikes devel-
oped locally at sites in the afferent population (open arrows

in control conditions. We examined postsynaptic sites 500 µm
apart, and the instants of epileptic spikes were excluded.
When BIC was injected into the CA3 (Fig. 7B, Experiment 1),
local epileptic spikes developed in the raw LFP at the site of
injection ( pre-CA3 in Fig. 7B) that produced large fEPSPs in
the postsynaptic CA1. Following ICA, these appeared selec-
tively in the Schaffer LFP generator ( post-CA1). The ongoing
postsynaptic Schaffer gamma activity that was strongly corre-
lated between pairs of sites in control conditions became dis-
torted following the administration of BIC (enlarged traces
below), although the intersite correlation remained high
(0.88 ± 0.02 and 0.84 ± 0.01 in control and BIC conditions,
respectively, n = 6 epochs). However, when BIC was injected
into the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC; Fig. 7B, Experiment
2), the spatial correlation of the MPP generator obtained in
pairs of postsynaptic DG sites increased notably (0.5 ± 0.02
and 0.77 ± 0.03 in control and BIC conditions, respectively).

Discussion
In general, it is difﬁcult to interpret LFPs and their zonal di-
vergence in situations where synaptic currents of different
presynaptic origins combine. Using spatially discriminating
techniques in the hippocampus, we have separated and ana-
lyzed up to 6 stable laminar LFP generators, each with distinct
synaptic territories in speciﬁc domains of principal cells and
hippocampal subﬁelds, these matching known terminations
of local and extrinsic presynaptic populations. LFP synaptic
generators feature the minimum modules of spatial coherence
that at least in one case (Schaffer) was modular-like and deter-
mined by the common topology of presynaptic units. Others
are less regionalized and can be better explained by wide-
spread coalescence of synaptic territories from presynaptic
individual cell’s axons, for example, the somatic inhibitory
input to granule cells. We have shown that, for distant record-
ings separated more than the size of structural modules, the
pathway-speciﬁc LFPs reﬂect the independent activity of dis-
tinct groups of units in the same presynaptic population, such
that different modes of functional presynaptic ﬁring can be
recognized by the distinct spatial coverage of postsynaptic
generators.

There is a general consensus that LFPs arise from synchro-
nous currents in multicellular sources. While the theoretical
bases of LFPs have been well described (Lorente de Nó 1947;
Elul 1972; Klee and Rall 1977; Gloor 1985; Varona et al. 2000),
there exists certain lag in their experimental application over
involved neuronal structures. While data contingent with
speciﬁc LFP events (e.g., unitary activity, intracellular record-
ings: Buzsáki et al. 1983) provides valuable hint on their cellu-
lar sources, the detailed information on the geometry and
arrangement of unitary neuronal sources and activating inputs
is required for a reliable and unambiguous identiﬁcation. The
ongoing activity involves the activation of individual cells or
cell assemblies that may project to different parts of postsyn-
aptic regions. Hence, the LFP activity generated by input from
a single presynaptic population is not synchronous all over.
Besides, different extrinsic and local populations have dissim-
ilar axonal coverage of the dendritic domains in target cells,
thus generating LFPs of different spatial distribution. The
optimization of spatially discriminating techniques such as
ICA enables the separation of LFPs in the hippocampus into
individual generators with a constant spatial distribution

spontaneous ﬁring synchronism in presynaptic neurons that gives rise to hippocampal
LFP generators. The Schaffer and MPP generators were obtained independently from
LFP proﬁles in 2 parallel arrays (r1 and r2; 0.5 mm apart). Stimulating electrodes (S1
and S2) were placed in the ipsilateral CA3 and the medial portion of the angular
bundle for the test activation of studied pathways. One injecting/recoding pipette
ﬁlled with BIC was placed in either the CA3 somatic layer (Experiment 1) or the
MEC. MEC-evoked responses to the right were recorded from the injecting pipette
and guided placement. (B) The long traces correspond to raw LFPs recorded by
injecting pipettes at afferent populations ( pre), and to simultaneous time activation of
the LFP generators in postsynaptic regions ( post). Upon microdrop injection of a
GABA blocker (BIC), epileptic spikes developed locally in both experiments (open
raw LFPs), which produced large synaptic
arrows in CA3 and MEC traces of
envelopes in LFP generators (arrows in Sch and MPP traces). However,
the
correlation of baseline activity in periods between epileptic spikes only increased in
the MPP generator. Although increased synchrony occurred in both afferent
populations, it is only reﬂected in the LFP generator whose minimal module of spatial
coherence is smaller than the recording interdistance (the MPP). Thus, while the
temporal pattern of Schaffer activities may change, the correlation between loci
activated by the same axons is unaffected, if it was already synchronous in control
conditions.

(closed arrows), ensuring topological connection between the
2 regions. If our hypothesis is correct, there should be no
variation in the correlation of LFP generators between pairs of
postsynaptic sites that already had a strong correlation due to
structural constraints, while increased afferent synchroniza-
tion would be expected when there is low spatial coherence

(Korovaichuk et al. 2010). By deﬁnition, pathway-speciﬁc gen-
erators exhibit full laminar coherence (as evoked potentials),
which eliminates the inherent problems of varying polarity
and amplitude when recording from different levels or strata.
Accordingly, the time activation of the LFP generators can be
used to establish their spatial extension by simple correlation
of the activities recorded at different loci.

Most LFP Generators are Pathway Speciﬁc, but not all
Synaptic Pathways Produce Observable LFPs
Like the evoked potential proﬁles generated by the speciﬁc
activation of anatomical pathways (Andersen et al. 1971),
ongoing LFP generators have smooth spatial distributions
with a single maximum and a spatial distribution of inward/
outward currents conﬁned to the cellular axis of either the
pyramidal or granule cells. Thus, the Schaffer, MPP, and LPP
excitatory generators have active sinks in both the CA1 st.
radiatum and the middle as well as outer thirds of the molecu-
lar layer, respectively. As expected, the activity of all these
generators is selectively depressed by blocking glutamate re-
ceptors. In turn, the sink/source proﬁles for the GCsom and
CA3som generators matched well with the expected proﬁles of
somatic/perisomatic inhibitory synapses, and their activities
were selectively abolished by GABA-R blockade. Therefore,
these generators most likely correspond to basket-cell type
inputs in each subﬁeld. We obtained conﬂicting results for the
strong LM generator, which was partially depressed by both
Glu and GABA-A receptor blockades, and that displayed a
temporal succession of sinks and sources. This dendritic
domain may generate active sinks from perforant path acti-
vation (Leung and Peloquin, 2010) and active sources from
Or-lac interneurons. One possible explanation is that the LM
generator is a combination of 2 inputs that are difﬁcult to sep-
arate by ICA, 1 excitatory and 1 inhibitory, which converge on
the same dendritic domain at the distal tuft (Brankacˇk et al.
1993). The stability of all the LFP generators identiﬁed was
conﬁrmed by chronic recordings revealing the essentially
identical subcellular and regional spatial distributions. Thus,
we consider each LFP generator as a pathway-speciﬁc LFP
component with populations of origin in the ipsilateral CA3,
medial and lateral entorhinal cortices, and 3 different local
inhibitory subnetworks: 2 of the basket type in CA3 and GC,
and a distal-projecting subnetwork in the CA1 ﬁeld.

It is noteworthy that the anatomical connections whose
synchronous activation produce measurable evoked ﬁeld
potentials outnumber the hippocampal LFP generators de-
scribed here. Among the unrepresented inputs are those from
the septum, the contralateral (commissural) inputs to the CA1
and CA3, and a number of local inhibitory inputs in all sub-
ﬁelds (Andersen et al. 1961; Amaral 1978; Buzsaki and Eidel-
berg 1982; Somogyi and Klausberger 2005). However, not all
synaptic currents contribute signiﬁcantly to macroscopic
LFPs, rather only those that conform to the appropriate spatial
structure and temporal pattern (Elul 1972; Makarova et al.
2011; Ho et al. 2012). Thus, poor laminar segregation of
axonal arborization, or extreme levels of activity (too scarce
or too frequent), would not generate a sufﬁcient extracellular
current or the required time ﬂuctuation, but they are still
essential for information processing and postsynaptic output.

(Fernández-Ruiz, Makarov, Benito,

Functional Implications of Pathway-Speciﬁc Structural
Boundaries of LFP Coherence
The CA1 Schaffer and the MPP entorhinal inputs exhibit sig-
niﬁcantly different modules of spatial coherence in spite of
the similar temporal structure of their respective ongoing
activities with dominant excitatory quanta in gamma frequen-
cies
2012;
Fernández-Ruiz, Makarov, Herreras 2012). For these inputs,
presynaptic neurons project axons that branch out and leave
multiple buttons en passage, which should produce near-
synchronous LFPs over an extended postsynaptic area. There-
fore, the differential minimal spatial modules are probably
due to additional anatomical factors, such as the degree of the
spatial overlap of axonal territories of individual cells. Schaf-
fer LFPs are highly coherent within 2 × 0.5 mm sheets that lie
roughly parallel to the midline in the dorsal hippocampus,
which is approximately the extension of a single CA3 pyrami-
dal cell axonal arborization in the CA1 (Ishizuka et al. 1990),
although they fall off sharply in the lateral direction beyond
0.5 mm. The covariance of the amplitude and the character-
istic rostro-caudal delay of elementary µ-fEPSPs can only be
explained by near-synchronous activation of multiple CA1
pyramidal cells by axons with dominant rostro-caudal orien-
tation and a similar topology originating in groups of simul-
taneously ﬁring CA3 pyramidal cells (Hjorth-Simonsen 1973;
Li et al. 1994; Fig. 8A). For recording positions separated lat-
erally by larger distances, the increasing divergence of Schaf-
fer LFPs reﬂects the independent activity of distinct subsets of
presynaptic CA3 neurons. Thus, the basal activity of the Schaf-
fer generator is reminiscent of the lamellar concept proposed
by Andersen et al. (1971), at least for this segment of the hip-
pocampal network. However, the longitudinal CA3–CA1 com-
munication that is also present (Li et al. 1994) may not be
based on functional assemblies with overlapping topological
projections. The Schaffer SPWs represent a notable nonlamel-
lar exception that cover much larger and more variable zones
of the CA1, which is slowly activated in spatial sequence
without an apparent preferred direction, and that can stop
suddenly at different sites. These features are compatible with
a slow avalanche-like longitudinal activation of CA3 units over
extended septo-temporal levels, possibly through the local re-
current network (e.g., Vincent et al. 2012). Thus, the differen-
tial spatial coverage of SPWs and µ-fEPSPs reﬂect 2 modes
and degrees of synchronization in presynaptic CA3 units.

In turn, the extremely low spatial correlation of LFPs pro-
duced by the MPP is indicative of highly localized clusters of
postsynaptic activity. Such a pattern may result from the
spatial divergence of individual perforant pathway axons,
while the strong curvature of the DG could further minimize
extracellular clustering of synaptic currents, even for synchro-
nous events (Fig. 8B). This implies that the use of different
recording sites permits a more topological reading of the
ongoing activity of presynaptic entorhinal cells. The obvious
impractical consequence is that one-site recordings of the
activity of the MPP generator cannot be taken as a representa-
tive of entorhinal population activity.

We have demonstrated that inhibitory inputs can act as
strong LFP generators. Notably the inhibitory plexuses of indi-
vidual interneurons extend over distances shorter than the
size of coherent modules (Somogyi and Klausberger 2005).
To reconcile these ﬁndings, we may suppose that multiple

Figure 8. Proposed structural and functional determinants of spatial coherence for some hippocampal LFP generators. (A) Excitatory Schaffer input to CA1. Each CA3 pyramidal
neuron sends axon that leaves multiple collaterals in CA1 with dominant parallel orientation (1) leaving synaptic buttons en passant (2) on numerous CA1 pyramidal cells.
Functional CA3 pyramidal cell assemblies have similar axonal territories (3) and their joint activation produces near-synchronous synaptic currents on a narrow dendritic band of
CA1 pyramidal cells (4) that conforms a strip-like spatial module of coherent LFP activity. The width of the strip is thus deﬁned by the average coverage of individual cell’s axon
and the common topology of a functional CA3 assembly. Note that the same spatial module can be “occupied” by different CA3 assemblies as long as they have similar
topology (e.g., sequence of µ-fEPSPs). The apparent “lamellar” organization (5) manifests at different septo-temporal
levels of the CA1, but is broken up when afferent ﬁring
synchrony organizes differently, as during SPWs in which coﬁring CA3 neurons extend over widespread septo-temporal levels. (B) Perforant path input. The LFP activity is poorly
correlated in nearby sites, possibly because of the fanning of axon branches (1) and reduced spatial overlap of synchronous synaptic currents caused by excessive curvature. (C)
Granule cell somatic inhibition (GCsom generator). The axonal plexus of basket-cell interneurons (in gray) may produce inhibitory currents in the somata of the large number of
granule cells (in black). (2, 3) Synchronous modulation of basket-cell subpopulation produces the coalescence of basket-cell synaptic territories, thus spatial coherence of the
GCsom generator extends much more than the extension of one cell’s axonal plexus.

homogeneous interneurons forming functional subnetworks
are jointly modulated by an external driver or are mutually
synchronized. Accordingly, the inhibitory currents produced
by axons from individual interneurons merge in large steady
modules (Fig. 8C). This concept coincides with functional
results that propose correlated activity in interneuron subnet-
works (Whittington et al. 1995; Fukuda and Kosaka, 2000; Ho
et al. 2012). Interestingly, we observed variations in the spec-
tral coherence between 2 readings of the GCsom inhibitory
generator despite a steady strong global correlation. We
propose that this may be a manifestation of functional coup-
ling/decoupling mechanisms of the units in the subnetwork
according to the information-processing demands.

We presented evidence demonstrating that the more pre-
synaptic neurons ﬁre synchronously (as witnessed by the oc-
currence of local epileptic spikes following disinhibition), the
greater the spatial correlation of LFPs in the postsynaptic
region, presumably by blending together coactivated postsyn-
aptic territories. As expected, this only occurs for the medial
entorhinal cortex projections in the DG that normally exhibit
low spatial correlation, but not for the Schaffer input to CA1
that has full coherence, at least within longitudinal strips. This
result provides empirical evidence supporting the notion that
territories) and temporal
both spatial (overlap of axonal
factors (their synchronous activation) play an important role
in the generation of LFPs. Moreover, our ﬁndings highlight
the peculiar transformation of synchronization in presynaptic
units into postsynaptic coherence,
into
spatial features of activity, which is essential to interpret zonal
LFP differences. Thus, ﬁring synchronization of all afferent
ﬁbers in a pathway, as by electric shocks, produces the com-
plete and nearly synchronous activation of the entire postsyn-
aptic region, that is, full spatial coherence of the recorded
ﬁeld potential activity. However, during ongoing activity, only
groups of afferent neurons ﬁre correlated spikes, and their
axons activate varying portions of the postsynaptic region ac-
cording to the topology of connections; hence, spatial coher-
ence of LFPs decreases. Since LFPs are the reﬂection of
the found
spiking activity in presynaptic populations,

1750 Spatial Modules of Activity of LFP Generators

(cid:129) Benito et al.

stereotyped spatial patterns of LFP coherence, as seen in
Schaffer µ-fEPSPs, or inhibitory GCsom potentials, denote the
speciﬁc temporal patterns of the activation of presynaptic
units.

The physiological relevance of spatial coherence is that it
helps us discerning when 2 recording sites are capturing the
same information from afferent neuron populations. Matching
LFPs is either due to overlapping axonal territories of presyn-
aptic units (whether ﬁring synchronously or not) or to the
synchronous ﬁring of presynaptic cells (whether their axons
overlap in target regions). However, differing LFPs necessarily
indicates varying activity in presynaptic units. Naturally, this
is only applicable to pathway-speciﬁc LFPs. In conclusion, the
ﬁnding of pathway-speciﬁc modules of LFP activity serves not
only to reveal the topology of connections, but also explains
LFP differences in nearby recordings. This represents a
necessary ﬁrst step to mapping their temporal changes in
activity and their correlations with full understanding of their
biophysical bases.
