Abstract Hippocampal ripples are transient population bursts that structure cortico- hippocampal 
communication and play a central role in memory processing. However, the mechanisms controlling 
ripple initiation in behaving animals remain poorly understood. Here we combine multisite extracel-
lular and whole- cell recordings in awake mice to contrast the brain state and ripple modulation of 
subthreshold dynamics across hippocampal subfields. We find that entorhinal input to the dentate 
gyrus (DG) exhibits UP and DOWN dynamics with ripples occurring exclusively in UP states. While 
elevated cortical input in UP states generates depolarization in DG and CA1, it produces persistent 
hyperpolarization in CA3 neurons. Furthermore, growing inhibition is evident in CA3 throughout the 
course of the ripple buildup, while DG and CA1 neurons exhibit depolarization transients 100 ms 
before and during ripples. These observations highlight the importance of CA3 inhibition for ripple 
generation, while pre- ripple responses indicate a long and orchestrated ripple initiation process in 
the awake state.

Editor's evaluation
This paper combines intracellular and extracellular recordings in the hippocampus in awake mice 
to investigate the initiation of sharp wave- ripples, synchronous bursts of activity thought to support 
memory replay. They report a specific hyperpolarization of the pyramidal cells in the CA3 subfield 
while the dentate granule cells or CA1 pyramidal cells are depolarized. This paper will be of interest 
to system neuroscientists interested in the cellular and network mechanisms of memory formation.

Introduction
Bidirectional  interactions  between  the  hippocampus  and  neocortical  areas  are  believed  to  play  a 
key role in memory consolidation (Squire, 1992). Hippocampal ripples are deemed essential for this 
process because the associated population activity reflects prior experience (Foster, 2017; Kudrimoti 
et al., 1999; Lee and Wilson, 2002; Wilson and McNaughton, 1994) and ripple disruption results 
in memory deficits (Ego- Stengel and Wilson, 2010; Girardeau et al., 2009; Jadhav et al., 2012). 
Ripples  provide  synchronous  volleys  that  drive  cortical  targets  and  co- occur  with  distinct  cortical 
network patterns (Battaglia et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2019; Ji and Wilson, 2007; Logothetis et al., 
2012; Mölle et al., 2006; Shein- Idelson et al., 2016; Siapas and Wilson, 1998; Wierzynski et al., 
2009). In particular, ripples normally occur during slow- wave sleep and quiet wakefulness when hippo-
campal  local  field  potentials  (LFPs)  display  large- amplitude  irregular  activity  (LIA)  (Buzsáki,  1986;

Jarosiewicz  and  Skaggs,  2004;  Kay  et  al.,  2016;  O’Keefe,  1976;  Vanderwolf,  1969),  whereas 
neocortical dynamics are marked by the presence of UP and DOWN states (UDS), alternating periods 
of  elevated  and  depressed  network  activity  that  can  also  be  observed  under  anesthesia  (Cowan 
and  Wilson,  1994;  Steriade  et  al.,  1993b;  Steriade  et  al.,  1993c).  Neocortical  and  hippocampal 
dynamics can be coordinated via the entorhinal cortex (EC), the main gateway between neocortical 
areas and the hippocampus, which provides direct input to the dentate gyrus (DG), and areas CA3 and 
CA1 (Amaral and Witter, 1989; Steward et al., 1976; Tamamaki and Nojyo, 1993). Experiments in 
sleeping and anesthetized animals show that the EC also exhibits UDS that modulate activity across 
hippocampal subfields (Hahn et al., 2012; Isomura et al., 2006). However, the influence of cortical 
UDS on hippocampal dynamics and ripple generation in wakefulness are not well understood.

Ripples are believed to be the product of excitatory buildup in the recurrent CA3 network, culmi-
nating in a population burst that drives CA1 spiking organized by the transient ripple oscillation 
(Buzsáki, 1986; Miles and Wong, 1983; Stark et al., 2014; Traub and Miles, 1991). This suggests 
that CA3 neurons should get progressively depolarized and come closer to firing threshold through 
the course of the ripple buildup. Separate from the buildup itself, the processes controlling ripple 
initiation and termination are not fully understood. In vitro experiments indicate that ripples are 
initiated once stochastic fluctuations in the population firing rate of CA3 pyramidal cells exceed a 
threshold level (de la Prida et al., 2006; Schlingloff et al., 2014), implying that an increase in the 
firing of CA3 neurons should result in a corresponding increase in the rate of ripple occurrence. 
Recent in vitro studies have also emphasized the importance of inhibitory neurons in ripple initi-
ation (Bazelot et al., 2016;  Ellender et al., 2010;  Schlingloff et al., 2014), while other studies 
suggested that area CA2 and a special class of CA3 cells play a key role in ripple initiation (Hunt 
et al., 2018; Oliva et al., 2016). Furthermore, there is growing evidence that the functional role 
of ripples as well as the mechanism of their initiation may differ across the awake and sleep states 
(Middleton and McHugh, 2020; Oliva et al., 2016; Roumis and Frank, 2015; Tang and Jadhav, 
2019). Whole- cell recordings in awake animals have opened a window to understanding the inter-
play between collective network activity and membrane potential (Vm) dynamics of hippocampal 
neurons,  which  can  reveal  the  nature  and  timing  of  synaptic  inputs  and  subthreshold  changes 
that  are  invisible  to  extracellular  recordings.  While  recent  efforts  have  examined  the  Vm  of  CA1 
neurons around ripples (English et al., 2014; Hulse et al., 2016) and the Vm modulation by brain 
state across hippocampal subfields (Hulse et al., 2017; Malezieux et al., 2020), the subthreshold 
dynamics of CA3 pyramidal cells around ripples and the impact of cortical inputs on Vm behavior 
in CA3 remain unknown.

Here we combine multisite extracellular and whole- cell recordings in awake mice to characterize 
and contrast the membrane potential dynamics of principal neurons in CA3 with that in the DG and 
CA1. Our results reveal that the membrane potential of CA3 neurons is modulated by brain state and 
ripples in a way that is largely opposite to the modulation of dentate granule cells and CA1 neurons. 
This  divergent  modulation  across  hippocampal  subfields  is  surprising  given  that  they  are  intercon-
nected  and  all  receive  inputs  from  the  entorhinal  cortex,  and  offers  insights  into  the  processes  of 
ripple initiation, build up, and termination.

Results
We  combined  whole- cell  recordings  of  principal  neurons  across  DG  (22  cells),  CA3  (32  cells),  and 
CA1  (32  cells)  with  multisite  extracellular  LFP  recordings  spanning  the  radial  extent  of  dorsal  CA1 
and DG in awake head- fixed mice that were free to run on a spherical treadmill (Figure 1). The loca-
tion, morphology, and membrane properties of the recorded cells are described in Figure 1—figure 
supplements  1–4.  Below  we  show  that  entorhinal  inputs  to  DG  exhibit  UP  and  DOWN  dynamics 
during  quiet  wakefulness,  with  ripples  occurring  exclusively  in  the  UP  state.  Analysis  of  how  these 
brain states influence membrane potential dynamics reveals that CA3 neurons hyperpolarize in the UP 
state when ripples occur, in contrast to neurons in DG and CA1. We then focus on characterizing how 
brain state is reflected in slow Vm trends around ripples. Finally, we analyze ripple triggered modula-
tion of fast Vm fluctuations which reveals a prevalence of inhibition in CA3 which grows through the 
ripple buildup. In contrast, DG and CA1 neurons exhibit transient depolarization not only after ripple 
onset but also 100 ms earlier.

Entorhinal inputs to DG exhibit UP and DOWN dynamics during quiet 
wakefulness
Based on LFP dynamics, the network state of the hippocampus can be classified as LIA, small irregular 
activity (SIA), or theta rhythmic, with LIA and SIA being the predominant states during quiet wakeful-
ness (Buzsáki, 1986; Jarosiewicz and Skaggs, 2004; Kay et al., 2016; O’Keefe, 1976; Vanderwolf, 
1969). Since this classification is typically based on a single hippocampal LFP, it does not consider 
the origin of the observed field fluctuations, but only their amplitude and frequency content. As a 
consequence,  synaptic  currents  due  to  inputs  from  the  EC  as  well  as  other  hippocampal  subfields

are reflected in the local field and cannot be dissociated. In order to address this, we used multisite 
LFP recordings and computed the laminar current source density (CSD) (Mitzdorf, 1985; Pettersen 
et al., 2006) throughout CA1 and DG, which in combination with the known circuit anatomy allowed 
us to infer the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic activity. An example estimate of this laminar CSD 
is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows several sharp wave- ripples associated with pronounced current 
sinks  in  stratum  radiatum  of  CA1  due  to  CA3  synaptic  input,  occurring  against  a  background  of 
synaptic activity in DG (see also Figure 2—figure supplement 6). On a longer timescale, the CSD 
clearly reveals alternating periods of high and low rates of transient synaptic activity lasting several 
seconds (Figure 2B) that are particularly prominent within the DG. Strikingly, these alternating periods 
appear to coincide with slow shifts in the membrane potential of an example CA3 pyramidal neuron 
(Figure 2B). To quantify the level of cortical input to the hippocampus, we averaged the rectified CSD 
over the molecular layer of DG (Figure 2). This measure reflects the magnitude and rate of transient 
synaptic currents due to inputs from layer II of the lateral and medial EC arriving at the outer two- 
thirds of the dentate molecular layer (Sullivan et al., 2011), as well as associational and return currents 
flowing in the inner third. Confirming our observations, the rectified DG CSD showed strong coher-
ence with the subthreshold membrane potential of the example CA3 neuron for frequencies below 
1 Hz (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). This result was consistent across DG, CA3, and CA1 cells 
(Figure 2—figure supplement 1B- D).

The  distribution  of  DG  CSD  activity  values  is  fit  well  by  a  binary  Gaussian  mixture  (Figure  2C) 
consistent with synaptic activity switching between high and low level regimes. Since EC inputs are 
responsible for much of the dentate synaptic currents, we identify these regimes as corresponding 
to entorhinal UDS. Since UDS in EC are coordinated with UDS in other cortical and thalamic areas, 
we  reasoned  that  the  DG  CSD  contains  information  about  widespread  brain  state  modulation  and 
would  therefore  be  correlated  to  other  brain  state  signatures  and  behavioral  metrics.  Indeed  we 
found that ripples tended to occur almost exclusively when DG CSD activity was high (UP state), while 
eyeblinks had the opposite relationship and occurred when DG CSD activity was low (DOWN state) 
(Figure 2C–E, Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, the DG CSD showed a strong coher-
ence with the slow changes (below 1 Hz) in pupil diameter (Figure 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 
1A).

In order to investigate these effects further we developed an unsupervised method for extracting 
UDS from the DG CSD based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) (Figure 2C–D). In addition to iden-
tifying state transition points, the segmentation allows the translation of the time axis into a circular 
UDS phase, so that event distributions can be computed with respect to the UP- DOWN phase. This 
analysis demonstrates that essentially all ripples occur within the UP state and the rate of ripple occur-
rence ramps up to a steady state value in the course of the UP state itself and abruptly terminates 
upon  transition  to  a  DOWN  state  (Figure  2E,  Figure  2—figure  supplement  2).  It  also  shows  that 
upon transition to the DOWN state the pupil quickly dilates, signaling increased arousal, and then 
gradually constricts through the course of the UP state, indicating a progressive reduction of arousal 
and attention to external stimuli through the course of the UP state (Figure 2—figure supplement 
3). Both UP and DOWN epoch durations were distributed approximately exponentially with means of 
3.06 s (UP) and 3.25 s (DOWN) and these values were consistent across recording sessions (Figure 2—
figure supplement 4).

These observations show that quiet wakefulness can be reliably decomposed into UDS that reflect 
increased and decreased EC inputs, respectively. This UDS classification reflects the dynamics of the 
cortical input to the hippocampus, in contrast to LIA/SIA segmentation that is influenced by the states 
of the hippocampal subfields themselves, which as we describe below are not necessarily coherent. 
Nevertheless,  LIA→SIA  transitions  mapped  closely  to  UP→DOWN  transitions,  with  SIA→LIA  tran-
sitions  also  concentrated  around  DOWN→UP  transitions  (Figure  2—figure  supplement  8).  These 
observations are consistent with UP states broadly overlapping with LIA and DOWN states with SIA.

CA3 membrane potential shifts are negatively correlated with 
entorhinal inputs to DG
What  is  the  impact  of  entorhinal  inputs  on  the  activity  of  hippocampal  neurons?  The  subthreshold 
membrane potential of the example CA3 neuron in Figure 2B is clearly related to the DG CSD and 
consequently to UP- DOWN states. Importantly, the relation is evident in the slow shifts in Vm and not

Figure 2. UP and DOWN states modulate slow Vm shifts and ripple occurrence. (A) Image of current source density (CSD) derived from the local field 
potential (LFP) traces (gray). Ripples, high- frequency oscillations indicated by the black arrows, are associated with current sinks (red) in stratum radiatum 
(sr) below the pyramidal cell layer (stratum pyramidale, sp). The bottom third of the image shows large current sources (blue) and sinks (red) within the 
molecular layers (mol) of dentate gyrus (DG). (B) Top: Image of the CSD on a longer timescale reveals alternating periods of high and low CSD activity. 
The two interrupted black lines mark the vertical extent of the suprapyramidal molecular layer of DG. The Vm of a CA3 neuron is superimposed in 
green. Notice that periods of low DG CSD activity (light colors) are associated with Vm depolarization. Bottom: DG CSD activity (black), quantified by 
averaging the rectified CSD over the molecular layer of DG and smoothing, normalized to a z- score. Subthreshold Vm (gray) for the CA3 neuron and its 
slow component (red) plotted as z- scores. Notice that the black and red traces are anti- correlated. The green stairstep trace marks epochs of elevated 
DG CSD activity (UP states) and decreased DG CSD activity (DOWN states). Ripples (blue dots) occur in the UP state. (C) Distribution of DG CSD activity 
fitted with a two component gaussian mixture. DG CSD activity at ripples (blue dots) and eye blinks (magenta), show preferential association with the 
UP and DOWN components, respectively. (D) Hidden Markov model (HMM) state detection based on DG CSD activity (black). DG CSD activity is high 
in the UP state (gray stripes), while the pupil (diameter in magenta) dilates at the onset of the DOWN state and then gradually constricts in the course 
of the UP state. Ripples and eye blinks are marked by blue and magenta dots, respectively. Horizontal scale bar is 3 s long. (E) (Top) Population average

overall (B3) have membrane potentials that are anti- correlated with DG CSD activity. (C) Same as (A) and (B), but for CA1 pyramidal neurons. The Vm 
of many CA1 neurons is positively correlated with DG CSD activity, but the Vm (red) leads the DG CSD (black) as in (C1), so correlation peaks occur at 
negative lags (C3). A subset of CA1 neurons exhibits negative correlations at positive lags.

in  the  superimposed  faster  fluctuations.  This  is  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  all  significant  coherence 
between Vm and rectified DG CSD occurs below 1 Hz (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We therefore 
separated the fast from the slow dynamics of the subthreshold membrane potential (Vm) fluctuations 
with a cutoff frequency of approximately 1 Hz (Figure 2—figure supplement 5).

Surprisingly, the membrane potential of the CA3 pyramidal neuron in Figure 2B is more hyperpo-
larized when DG CSD activity and hence the excitatory EC input rate is high, and conversely, more 
depolarized when EC input rate is low. Does EC input impact subthreshold activity in other hippo-
campal subfields in a similar way? To address this, we computed the cross- covariance between DG 
CSD activity and the slow Vm component of cells in DG, CA3, and CA1 (Figure 3). The majority of DG 
cells (21/22) displayed a positive correlation to EC inputs, the majority of CA3 neurons (26/32) exhib-
ited a negative correlation, while CA1 neurons were split in half. In other words, while the slow Vm

fluctuations in DG are nearly in sync with the DG 
CSD activity (Figure 3A and C), they are anticor-
related in CA3 (Figure 3B). Furthermore, a closer 
look  at  the  lag  associated  with  peak  absolute 
correlation reveals that while DG neurons follow 
DG CSD activity very closely (37 ms median lag), 
the  significantly  correlated  CA1  neurons  actu-
ally  lead  DG  CSD  activity  (–225ms  median  lag), 
while the trough of the CA3 negative correlation 
follows  DG  CSD  activity  (296  ms  median  lag) 
(Figure  3—figure  supplement  1).  This  subfield 
ordering  is  inconsistent  with  a  simple  feedfor-
ward activation along the trisynaptic circuit in the 
awake state.

How well can we estimate the slow Vm compo-
nent of hippocampal neurons from the DG CSD? 
All hippocampal subfields receive direct input from 
the entorhinal cortex (EC), and yet the pattern of 
modulation  by  the  UP- DOWN  state  cycle  varies 
across subfields. In order to understand how EC 
inputs  influence  hippocampal  neurons  we  used 
the  measured  DG  CSD  as  a  proxy  of  EC  input 
and  estimated  linear  transfer  models  for  each 
cell  treating  DG  CSD  activity  as  input  and  the 
cell’s  slow  Vm  component  as  the  model  output 
(Figure 4). We considered a class of finite impulse 
response (FIR) models allowing for non- zero filter 
values  at  negative  lags  and  hence  for  a  non- 
causal  influence  of  the  input  on  the  output.  The 
estimated  impulse  responses  (Figure  4A2–D2) 
revealed  that  while  DG  granule  cells  had  causal 
responses, many CA3 and CA1 cells showed posi-
tive filter values at negative lags (up to –250 ms) 
signaling a non- causal relation between DG CSD 
and Vm. This was consistent with the positive/nega-
tive  peak  correlation  lags  observed  for  DG/CA1 
cells  (Figure  3—figure  supplement  1A- B),  but 
revealed a non- causal effect in CA3 which was not 
evident in the cross- covariance analysis. At posi-
tive lags the impulse responses for the majority of 
DG and CA1 cells were positive, while they were 
negative (inhibitory) for the majority of CA3 pyra-
midal neurons. The estimated models allowed us 
to  simulate  the  step  responses  of  hippocampal 
neurons  (Figure  4A1–D1)  and  showed  that  as 
a  population  DG  and  CA3  exhibited  persistent 
depolarization and hyperpolarization in response 
to  sustained  EC  input,  respectively,  while  CA1 
showed  a  transient  depolarizing  response  that 
decayed  within  1  s.  We  also  simulated  the  slow 
Vm  components  of  hippocampal  neurons  from 
DG  CSD  and  found  good  qualitative  agreement 
with  the  experimental  observations  (Figure  4—
figure  supplement  1),  confirming  that  the

transfer models provide a succinct description of the behavior of hippocampal neurons in response to 
changing EC input levels.

CA3 neurons hyperpolarize during UP states
The slow Vm component and firing rate of hippocampal neurons were modulated at UP and DOWN 
transitions  (Figure  5—figure  supplement  1)  in  a  way  that  was  consistent  with  the  transfer  model 
predictions (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). To understand their behavior through the course of the 
UDS cycle, we analyzed the subthreshold membrane potential and spiking of hippocampal neurons 
as a function of the UDS phase (Figure 5). In particular, we computed the distribution of Vm values 
conditioned on the phase of the UDS cycle. These distributions displayed phase- dependent Vm means 
for the majority (82/86) of hippocampal neurons (Figure 5A1–D1, Figure 5—figure supplement 5) 
and many cells (42/86) also exhibited phase- dependent fast Vm component variance (Figure 5A2–D2, 
Figure 5—figure supplement 5). Several important differences between the hippocampal subfields 
were evident. Dentate granule cells were quite homogeneous in their behavior through the course of 
the UP- DOWN state and all but one cell showed sustained Vm depolarization which was maintained 
through the course of the UP state and was mirrored by a persistent hyperpolarization throughout 
the DOWN phase (Figure 5A1, Figure 5—figure supplement 5A). In contrast, about a third (9/32) of 
CA3 neurons exhibited the exact opposite behavior: sustained Vm hyperpolarization through the UP 
state and depolarization through the DOWN state (Figure 5B1, Figure 5—figure supplement 5A). 
The remaining population exhibited a more transient depolarization with a peak slightly preceding 
or coincident with the UP transition point (Figure 5B1). The CA1 pyramidal cell population displayed 
a level of diversity that was intermediate to that of DG and CA3. About 40% of CA1 neurons (13/32) 
were  depolarized  in  the  UP  state  and  hyperpolarized  in  the  DOWN  state,  but  the  responses  were 
more transient than in DG, with depolarization/hyperpolarization decaying through the course of the 
UP/DOWN state, respectively (Figure 5C1). The behavior of the remaining CA1 neurons appeared 
similar to that of the CA3 population. With respect to Vm fluctuations, DG granule cells exhibited the 
highest  variability,  exceeding  that  in  CA3  and  CA1  (Figure  5—figure  supplement  3A1- D1).  With 
respect  to  overall  Vm  fluctuations  only  CA1  neurons  displayed  state- dependent  modulation  of  Vm 
variability (Figure 5—figure supplement 3D1), with the UP state being associated with more variable 
Vm. Focusing on the fast Vm component alone, both CA1 neurons (14/32) and DG granule cells (9/22) 
showed a significant jump in variability during the UP state with no granule cells and only three CA1 
neurons having the opposite trend (Figure 5A2–D2, Figure 5—figure supplement 5C). In contrast, 
CA3  pyramidal  neurons  exhibited  both  jumps  and  drops  and  at  the  population  level  had  a  nearly 
constant level of Vm variability throughout the UP- DOWN state cycle, which equaled that of CA1 in 
the UP state, but exceeded it in the DOWN phase (Figure 5B2 and D2, Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 3D1). Interestingly, with respect to spiking two thirds of the population of DG (15/22) and CA1 
(22/32) neurons exhibited similar behavior, a significant increase in firing rate that persisted through 
the  course  of  the  UP  phase  (Figure  5A3–D3,  Figure  5—figure  supplement  5D).  In  contrast,  the 
firing behavior of CA3 neurons largely mirrored the behavior of the Vm mean, with about half of CA3 
neurons (17/32) exhibiting a significant increase in firing rate in the DOWN state and the remaining 
population showing a transient increase peaking near the UP transition point (Figure 5B3 and D3). 
Thus CA3 neurons were maximally hyperpolarized and had lowest firing probability at the end of the 
UP phase when the rate of ripple occurrence was highest (Figure 2E).

Inhibition dominates CA3 subthreshold behavior near awake ripples
It has long been appreciated that awake ripples preferentially occur during periods of quiet wake-
fulness  and  LIA.  Furthermore,  here  we  showed  that  when  quiet  wakefulness  is  segmented  into 
periods  of  UDS,  essentially  all  ripples  occur  in  the  EC  UP  state  (Figure  2E).  The  prevailing  view  is 
that ripples are the result of self- organized population bursts of activity that build within the recur-
rent CA3 network and then are transmitted to and further patterned by the CA1 network, where the 
ripple oscillation itself is readily observable in the local field near the pyramidal cell layer (Figure 2A; 
Buzsáki, 1986; Miles and Wong, 1983; Stark et al., 2014; Traub and Miles, 1991). How do neurons 
across the different hippocampal subfields participate in this process? To address this question we 
detected ripple onset times from the CA1 local field near the pyramidal cell layer and determined 
the  ripple- triggered  average  (RTA)  Vm  and  firing  rate  modulation  for  each  recorded  cell  (Figure  6,

the ripple- triggered Vm response on the timescale of seconds (compare [D1] and [D2]).

Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Since the RTA of the Vm is the sum of the RTAs of the fast and slow 
Vm  components,  we  determined  these  average  responses  separately  for  each  cell  and  component 
(Figure 6A1–D1 and A3–D3 ). The RTAs of the slow Vm component showed pronounced depolariza-
tion in DG with a peak before the ripple onset, a hyperpolarization in CA3 with a trough following the 
ripple onset, and mixed responses in CA1 (Figure 6A1–D1). Since ripples occurred exclusively during 
the UP state and the slow Vm component of hippocampal neurons was strongly influenced by state, 
we hypothesized that the RTA slow Vm response depended strongly on the pattern of EC input and

how each cell was impacted by it. We therefore simulated the slow Vm component for each cell using 
the linear transfer models we had estimated (Figure 4) and computed the RTA of the simulated slow 
Vm response (Figure 6A2–D2). The RTAs of the observed and simulated slow Vm components showed 
good qualitative agreement indicating that on the timescale of seconds Vm trends near ripples are 
strongly influenced by the pattern of EC UDS transitions.

In contrast, the mean of the fast Vm component is very weakly influenced by state and therefore 
its RTA should reflect synaptic activity consistently timed with respect to the ripple onset. Consistent 
with previous studies, we found that the fast RTA Vm waveform for most CA1 pyramidal neurons had 
a sharp prominent peak following the ripple onset, followed by a steep return to baseline or hyper-
polarization within a 100ms (Figure 6C3; Hulse et al., 2016). This behavior was mirrored in the firing 
rate modulation of CA1 cells (Figure 6D3) and is consistent with the notion that CA1 exhibits a highly 
synchronous population burst associated with ripple oscillations.

Since the population event in CA1 is presumably due to a self- organized population burst in CA3, 
one might expect that the fast RTA waveforms in CA3 should resemble those in CA1, but this was not 
the case (Figure 6B3). While a minority CA3 neurons (9/32) exhibited a small depolarizing peak near 
the ripple- onset, the most consistent feature of the fast RTA Vm waveform in CA3 was the prominent 
hyperpolarization that reached a trough roughly 100 ms following ripple onset and recovered within 
300 ms. The population average response shows that the decrease in Vm had begun as early as 150 
ms prior to the ripple onset (Figure 6D3). Similarly, while several CA3 neurons showed an increase 
in firing rate just prior to the ripple onset, about a third of the CA3 population exhibited a reduc-
tion in firing rate before and especially following the ripple onset (Figure 6B4 and D4). These data 
demonstrate  that  extensive  inhibition,  rather  than  excitation,  is  the  hallmark  of  CA3  subthreshold 
activity before and after ripple bursts. It is worth noting that most neurons, even with hyperpolarizing 
average response, experienced depolarization and firing during a subset of ripples, consistent with 
a sparse activation of CA3 during ripples. Further analysis of the CA3 cells with a depolarizing peak 
near the ripple onset (9/32 cells) revealed that they do not have significantly different resting Vm, spike 
threshold, burst index or spikes per burst compared to the rest of the CA3 population (Figure 6—
figure supplement 3A, B). However, these CA3 cells had a lower firing probability in the DOWN state 
compared to the rest of the CA3 population.

Finally,  while  the  dentate  gyrus  has  not  been  traditionally  considered  to  be  instrumental  to  the 
process of ripple generation, the fast RTA Vm waveforms of granule cells showed clear modulation 
with about half of the population exhibiting a depolarization peak following ripple onset with a similar 
time course to that seen in CA1 (Figure 6A3). Interestingly, about half of DG granule cells also showed 
another depolarization peak occurring 100 ms prior to ripple onset (Figure 6A3 and D3). Upon closer 
examination a similarly timed depolarizing peak could be seen in the CA1 response prior to ripple 
onset, although of much smaller magnitude in comparison to the post- ripple depolarization. Similarly, 
a  sharp  wave  of  smaller  amplitude  is  also  consistently  observed  100ms  before  ripple  onset  (Hulse 
et  al.,  2016).  The  two  peaks  were  also  present  in  the  rectified  DG  CSD  triggered  on  ripple  onset 
(Figure 2—figure supplement 7A3). Since ripples can occur in close succession at intervals close to 
100ms, we wondered if such ripple bursts could contribute to the observed pre- ripple depolarization. 
To test this hypothesis we compared the fast RTA Vm aligned to the onset of isolated single ripples with 
that aligned to the onset of ripple doublets. The pre- ripple depolarization in DG and CA1 was similar 
for isolated ripples and ripple doublets arguing against the hypothesis that pre- ripple responses were 
due to ripple bursts (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). These data indicate that DG should not be 
viewed as a passive bystander in the awake ripple generation process and that the ripple proper is 
preceded by coordinated activity not only in CA3, but also in CA1 and DG.

What  circuit  mechanisms  may  be  responsible  for  the  observed  subthreshold  activity  around 
ripples? Since CA3 is considered to play a key role in the process of ripple generation, we reasoned 
that  influences  on  subthreshold  activity  originating  in  CA3  should  scale  in  proportion  to  the  CA3 
population  burst  size.  We  inferred  this  size  indirectly  from  the  amplitude  of  the  ripple- associated 
sharp wave in stratum radiatum of CA1 or equivalently by the magnitude of the underlying synaptic 
current  due  to  Schaffer  collateral  activation  (Mizunuma  et  al.,  2014).  We  then  divided  the  ripples 
from each recording session in two halves, big and small, depending on whether they were associated 
with above- median or below- median CA3 burst size. Finally, we computed the fast RTA Vm waveform 
separately for big and small CA3 events and compared the results (Figure 7). The size of the CA3

burst had little effect on the DG RTA waveform, apart from a slight increase in hyperpolarization about 
100ms following ripple onset that was associated with the bigger events (Figure 7A1–A3). In contrast, 
subthreshold activity in CA3 clearly reflected the size of the CA3 population event (Figure 7B1–B3). 
Larger CA3 events were associated with more sustained depolarization up to 300ms prior to the ripple 
onset and deeper hyperpolarization following (Figure 7B3). In CA1, bigger CA3 events were associ-
ated with slightly more depolarization up to 250ms prior to the ripple onset and during the post- ripple

peak, but the most notable difference was the increased hyperpolarization about 100ms following the 
ripple onset (Figure 7C1–C3). These data indicate that feedback inhibition within CA3 is most likely 
responsible for the subthreshold hyperpolarization seen in the fast Vm component around ripples in 
CA3. Consistent with our previous study, it also suggests that feedforward inhibition from CA3 to CA1 
may play an important role in controlling the population event size in CA1 and may contribute to the 
post- ripple hyperpolarization (Hulse et al., 2016).

Discussion
The results above show that the Vm modulation of CA3 pyramidal neurons by entorhinal input and 
ripples is largely opposite to that of DG granule cells and CA1 pyramidal neurons. On the timescale of 
seconds, slow shifts in the Vm of CA3 neurons are negatively correlated to the UP- DOWN transitions in 
the level of entorhinal input to DG. Consequently many CA3 neurons exhibit hyperpolarization in the 
UP state in contrast to DG and CA1 neurons, which are in sync with EC inputs. This subfield- specific 
modulation  by  UDS  explains  the  slow  trends  in  the  membrane  potential  leading  to  and  following 
awake  ripples.  On  a  sub- second  timescale,  both  DG  and  CA1  neurons  exhibit  depolarization  tran-
sients both ~100 ms before and immediately after the ripple onset, while CA3 neurons show a prom-
inent hyperpolarization that starts to build before and reaches maximum after the ripple onset. The 
magnitude of the CA3 hyperpolarization scales with the size of the CA3 population burst pointing to 
feedback inhibition as its likely source.

UDS differentially modulate activity across DG, CA3, and CA1
Neocortical dynamics during NREM (non- Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and anesthesia show intrinsic 
alternation between periods of elevated activity (UP states) and relative quiescence (DOWN states) 
(Cowan and Wilson, 1994; Steriade et al., 1993a). The entorhinal cortex is the major gateway linking 
the neocortex with the hippocampal formation and has been shown to exhibit UDS associated with 
bimodal membrane potential distributions of EC neurons (Isomura et al., 2006). Despite an absence 
of  bimodality,  the  subthreshold  activity  and  the  spiking  of  hippocampal  neurons  is  modulated  by 
cortical  UDS  in  a  subfield- specific  manner  both  in  sleep  and  under  anesthesia  (Hahn  et  al.,  2007; 
Isomura  et  al.,  2006;  Sullivan  et  al.,  2011).  We  found  that  DG  molecular  layer  currents  exhibit 
UP- DOWN dynamics indicating that the EC undergoes UDS transitions in quiet wakefulness as well 
that modulate activity across hippocampal subfields.

Our  results  regarding  UDS  modulation  in  quiet  wakefulness  are  largely  consistent  with  corre-
sponding observations in NREM sleep and under anesthesia, but there were also some notable differ-
ences that we highlight below. We observed pronounced modulation of both subthreshold activity 
and spiking at the DOWN→UP transition in all hippocampal subfields including a 50% increase in the 
baseline firing rate of CA3 neurons preceding the DOWN→UP transition, consistent with (Isomura 
et al., 2006) and in contrast to previous reports which found no modulation of CA3 unit activity in 
sleep  (Sullivan  et  al.,  2011)  or  weak  and  mixed  modulation  in  anesthetized  animals  (Hahn  et  al., 
2007).  We  also  find  that  awake  ripples  occur  essentially  exclusively  during  the  UP  state,  and  not 
merely with an increased probability relative to the DOWN state (Sullivan et al., 2011). Furthermore, 
awake  ripples  occurred  throughout  the  UP  state  and  were  not  concentrated  near  the  DOWN→UP 
transitions (Battaglia et al., 2004). Finally, in our data the vast majority of CA1 neurons were depolar-
ized on the DOWN→UP transition and had elevated firing rates in the UP state in contrast to previous 
observations under anesthesia (Hahn et al., 2007; Isomura et al., 2006).

While the majority of recorded neurons were influenced by UDS, the nature of the modulation is 
subfield- specific. Granule cells in DG by and large follow the EC inputs and show sustained depo-
larization  and  firing  rate  increase  throughout  the  UP  state  mirrored  by  relative  hyperpolarization 
and reduced firing in the DOWN state. Pyramidal neurons in CA1 also depolarize and fire more on 
the  DOWN→UP  transition,  but  these  responses  are  more  transient  than  in  DG.  Consequently,  the 
expected membrane potential across the CA1 population has a triangular wave shape as a function 
of UDS phase, unlike the square wave shape characteristic of the DG population. This triangular wave 
shape is almost symmetric with respect to DOWN→UP transition and as a result the Vm conditional 
means in the UDS are very similar, despite the clear Vm modulation by UDS phase. The CA1 popula-
tion starts depolarizing before the DOWN→UP transition and the DG granule cells. This is reflected in

the non- causal transfer model impulse response of CA1 pyramidal cells, which is consistent with the 
presence of a feedback loop via the CA1→EC connection, but also suggests the presence of another 
excitatory source, such as CA3, that leads EC activity.

How  can  activity  in  CA3  lead  given  that  CA3  is  downstream  of  both  the  EC  and  the  DG?  The 
majority of CA3 pyramidal neurons are negatively correlated to DG molecular layer currents, which 
is surprising since CA3 and DG receive excitatory input from EC, while the mossy fibers (DG→CA3) 
form powerful excitatory ‘detonator’ synapses on the proximal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons. 
Despite this anatomical organization suggesting that CA3 activity should follow that in EC and DG, 
CA3  pyramidal  cells  in  fact  show  peak  depolarization  and  elevated  firing  before  the  DOWN→UP 
transition, thus leading both CA1 and DG. Furthermore, a third of the CA3 population is more depo-
larized in the DOWN state, while the rest exhibit transient depolarization right before the DOWN→UP 
transition. This is reflected in the negative impulse response of the CA3 transfer model with sustained 
negative step response. The modulation of the population firing rate in CA3 by UDS is consistent with 
CA3 being responsible for the CA1 lead over DG activity.

What mechanisms may account for the CA3 behavior? One possibility is that DG and/or EC inputs 
provide powerful feedforward inhibition to CA3 pyramidal neurons. Indeed mossy fibers (DG→CA3) 
not only form large mossy terminals on CA3 pyramidal cells but also contact interneurons via filopodial 
extensions, providing an anatomical substrate for feedforward inhibition (Acsády et al., 1998). The 
balance between feedforward excitation and inhibition depends on the pattern of granule cell activity: 
low  frequency  activation  of  the  mossy  fibers  results  in  powerful  slow  inhibition  of  CA3  pyramidal 
neurons  while  at  higher  frequencies  an  initial  depolarization  precedes  the  inhibition  (Zucca  et  al., 
2017). Through this mechanism the elevated DG activity in the UP state may induce a concomitant 
suppression in the majority of CA3 pyramidal neurons during the UP state. As granule cells reduce 
their firing in the DOWN state, the CA3 circuit is released from the DG- mediated feedforward inhibi-
tion and the recurrent CA3 connections may support a sustained increase in population activity. This 
recurrent excitation is controlled by the strong feedback inhibition present in CA3. The non- causal 
positive component of the CA3 transfer model impulse response and the timing of CA3 firing relative 
to the DOWN→UP transition indicate that CA3 may play an important role in ushering the subsequent 
UP state by providing excitation to EC via CA1. These observations are inconsistent with a feedfor-
ward activation of the trisynaptic pathway, suggesting a more complex interplay of intrahippocampal 
and perforant pathways.

Membrane potential dynamics around ripples in quiet wakefulness
The recurrent circuit of CA3 has long been hypothesized to function as an autoassociative memory 
network (Marr, 1971) and to support the buildup of population activity underlying the ripple genera-
tion process (Buzsáki, 2015). Indeed, acute silencing of Schaffer collaterals during wakefulness abol-
ishes ripples (Davoudi and Foster, 2019; Yamamoto and Tonegawa, 2017). While the membrane 
potential of CA1 pyramidal neurons near ripples has been shown to exhibit a gradual ramping and 
a transient depolarization followed by a prolonged inhibition (Hulse et al., 2016), the subthreshold 
dynamics of DG granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons near ripples in awake animals had not been 
fully characterized.

We observed that the ripple- triggered membrane potential of hippocampal neurons is modulated 
on  a  timescale  of  seconds,  with  DG  granule  cells  showing  depolarization,  CA3  pyramidal  neurons 
hyperpolarization, and CA1 cells exhibiting weaker modulation. Since ripples occur almost exclusively 
in the UP state and the slow Vm dynamics of hippocampal cells are modulated by UDS in a subfield- 
specific fashion, we hypothesized and confirmed that the slow Vm responses near ripples can be qual-
itatively accounted for by the UDS influence on hippocampal cells.

How does UDS influence hippocampal network excitability? It has been proposed that during NREM 
sleep hippocampal dynamics exhibit a stable, but excitable quiescent state, such that activity fluctu-
ations can produce a transient population excitation representing a ripple (Levenstein et al., 2019). 
Our data indicate that in quiet wakefulness UDS modify hippocampal network excitability because no 
ripples are produced in the DOWN state. We illustrate this behavior in a mean firing rate model in 
the framework described in Levenstein et al., 2019, featuring two (EC and CA3) adapting recurrent 
neural populations (Figure 8). In the model the EC population influences CA3 activity by providing a 
net inhibitory input as well as by modulating the strength of the CA3 recurrent excitation (Figure 8A).

In  the  real  circuit  the  latter  influence  may  be  due  to  UDS- dependent  changes  in  neuromodulatory 
inputs, such as cholinergic tone, as exhibited, for example, by pedunculopontine cholinergic neurons 
(Mena- Segovia et al., 2008). The majority of the cholinergic input to the hippocampus originates in 
the  medial  septum  and  optogenetic  stimulation  of  septal  ChAT- positive  neurons  suppresses  ripple 
generation  (Hunt  et  al.,  2018;  Vandecasteele  et  al.,  2014).  Acetylcholine  is  known  to  inhibit  the

efficacy of recurrent synaptic  transmission in  CA3 by  acting on presynaptic  muscarinic  receptors  in 
the  associational–commissural  fiber  system  (Hasselmo  et  al.,  1995;  Hasselmo  and  Schnell,  1994; 
Vogt and Regehr, 2001) and cholinergic tone is presumably at its lowest during ripple generation in 
the EC UP state. Thus the efficacy of CA3 recurrent connections together with dentate and entorhinal 
input to CA3 and the associated feedforward inhibition can act as bifurcation parameters for the CA3 
network dynamics that change network excitability thereby preventing ripple occurrence during the 
cortical  DOWN  state  (Figure  8E–F).  This  is  counterintuitive  because  many  CA3  neurons  are  more 
active and depolarized in the DOWN state or near the DOWN→UP transition and so, according to the 
stochastic- refractory model of ripple initiation (Schlingloff et al., 2014) the rate of ripple occurrence 
should coincide with the modulation of CA3 activity by UDS, which is contradicted by the fact that 
ripples occur in the UP state. In our model, CA3 network excitability is shown to be restricted to the 
EC UP state when the mean CA3 rate is lower compared to the DOWN state (Figure 8B–C). This is 
possible  because  of  the  push- pull  influences  of  the  net  inhibitory  input  which  lowers  CA3  network 
excitability, and the CA3 recurrent strength potentiation which increases it. Hence, in the UP state the 
CA3 network is inhibited but excitable, while in the DOWN state it is disinhibited but not excitable 
(Figure 8).

These data suggest that increased inhibition in CA3 may be a prerequisite for ripple initiation. This is 
consistent with in vitro work showing that reducing GABAA- mediated inhibition in hippocampal slices 
abolishes spontaneously occurring sharp wave- ripple events in CA3 (Bazelot et al., 2016; Ellender 
et al., 2010; Schlingloff et al., 2014). The relative hyperpolarization in CA3 during the UP state may 
reflect  the  role  of  certain  local  (Katona  et  al.,  2014;  Viney  et  al.,  2013)  or  long- range  projecting 
interneurons (Basu et al., 2016; Unal et al., 2018) in suppressing the initiation of ripples. According 
to one view, ripple generation may be the result of disinhibition; however, our data does not offer 
clear evidence for widespread disinhibition in CA3 preceding the population burst (Evangelista et al., 
2020). Importantly, ripple generation by disinhibition does not account for the lack of ripples in the 
DOWN  state,  despite  the  elevated  neuronal  activity  in  CA3.  Its  origin  notwithstanding,  membrane 
hyperpolarization in CA3 may influence ripple initiation by affecting voltage- gated conductances and 
thereby changing the excitability of CA3 neurons to make them more likely to fire or burst in response 
to transient depolarizing input. Changes in inhibition across the CA3 network may shift the region of 
ripple initiation, allowing for reactivation of diverse memory traces stored within the CA3 network.

On a faster timescale, the average Vm responses near ripples reveal two consistent features. First, 
the majority of CA3 neurons exhibit a brief (~300 ms) hyperpolarization locked to the ripple onset in 
addition to the broad (~3 s) UDS- mediated hyperpolarization. This brief hyperpolarization grows with 
the size of the CA3 population burst, quantified by the associated sharp wave amplitude, therefore 
pointing  to  feedback  inhibition  as  its  source.  This  suggests  that  feedback  inhibition  is  a  consistent 
feature of the buildup process in CA3. This inhibition likely arises from several classes of interneurons 
that have been shown to exhibit elevated firing around ripples in both CA3 and CA1 (Klausberger 
et  al.,  2003;  Somogyi  et  al.,  2014;  Tukker  et  al.,  2013).  However,  the  distinct  Vm  responses  we 
observed around ripples indicate that inhibition is tuned differently in CA3 and CA1. In particular, in 
CA1 inhibition imposes oscillatory patterning on the Vm that rides on a wave of depolarization, while in 
CA3 inhibition summates to produce a net hyperpolarization. In both areas however, fast fluctuations 
in the membrane potential persist throughout the ripple period allowing CA3 neurons to fire despite 
the net hyperpolarization. These results suggest that the relative gain of feedback inhibition is greater 
than that of recurrent excitation for the majority of the CA3 neurons and hence the population burst 
can only build up by recruiting the CA3 neurons most strongly connected to a sparse active subset. 
This may reflect a winner- take- all mechanism for controlling both the sparsity and the specificity of the 
neuronal sequences activated in CA3 during a ripple. The growing inhibition during the course of a 
ripple also provides a mechanism for ripple termination.

Second, DG granule cells exhibit two transient depolarizations of comparable amplitude ~100ms 
before and immediately after the ripple onset. Similarly timed features are present in the Vm of CA1 
pyramidal  neurons,  albeit  the  pre- ripple  depolarization  is  significantly  smaller  than  the  post- ripple 
one.  In  CA1,  both  depolarizations  are  associated  with  sharp  waves  of  proportional  magnitudes  in 
stratum radiatum (Figrue 4A in Hulse et al., 2016), implicating CA3 as the source for both. The DG 
activation  is  consistent  with  the  presence  of  a  backprojection  from  CA3  to  DG  (Scharfman,  2007; 
Szabo et al., 2017) and can influence ripple- associated CA3 activity, consistent with previous lesion

studies (Sasaki et al., 2018). These results indicate a long and orchestrated ripple initiation process 
in  the  awake  state,  extending  beyond  the  roughly  50ms  period  of  excitatory  activity  buildup  that 
proceeds ripples in vitro (Schlingloff et al., 2014).

While there are consistent features within each subfield with respect to UDS and ripple modula-
tion,  there  is  also  variability  of  responses  across  cells.  Resting  Vm  and  cell  location  along  the  prox-
imodistal  and  deep- superficial  axes  could  be  factors  influencing  the  UDS  and  ripple  modulation. 
Indeed, previous studies have shown a gradient of connectivity and intrinsic cell properties along the 
proximodistal axis in CA3 (Sun et al., 2017), and differential responses of CA1 neurons in deep and 
superficial layers of CA1 (Valero et al., 2015; Valero and de la Prida, 2018). Analysis of UP- DOWN 
modulation  as  a  function  of  resting  Vm  and  proximodistal  location  of  each  cell  (Figure  5—figure 
supplement 4) did not reveal any significant trends. Furthermore, similar analysis of ripple modulation 
did not reveal significant trends either, except for the fact that the most depolarized CA3 cells tend to 
hyperpolarize most during ripples, consistent with the fact that these cells are furthest away from the 
GABAa reversal potential and experience the highest driving force (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). 
However, our recordings do not span the full proximodistal axis and may hence not be ideally suited 
to test the dependence of our results on proximodistal location. Furthermore, we record from multiple 
neurons in each experiment (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) which does not allow us to unequiv-
ocally identify the depth of each neuron within the cell layer. Future experiments can provide more 
conclusive evidence concerning the factors that explain the variability of subthreshold modulation by 
UDS and ripples across the hippocampal subfields.

These results provide novel insights into the processes of ripple initiation, build up, and termina-
tion  in  awake  animals.  Ripples  occur  exclusively  in  UP  states  characterized  by  increased  entorhinal 
inputs to DG and associated with pronounced hyperpolarization of CA3 pyramidal cells. This suggests 
that  broad  inhibition  in  CA3  may  be  a  prerequisite  for  ripple  initiation.  Furthermore,  DG  and  CA1 
pre- ripple responses suggest that ripples are not initiated as isolated events within CA3, but are the 
culmination of extended interplay across multiple areas. This may reflect the role of cortical inputs in 
influencing the neuronal patterns replayed by the hippocampus during awake ripples, consistent with 
their role in spatial decision- making. Finally, growing hyperpolarization in CA3 throughout the course 
of a ripple suggests that feedback inhibition is a key feature of ripple buildup as well as termination. 
This may reflect a winner- take- all mechanism, by which a few neurons that fire overcoming a back-
ground of inhibition in UP states, further suppress all other neurons via feedback inhibition, ensuring 
sparseness and selectivity of transient network pattern activation.

Materials and methods
Head fixation surgery
The methods used were the same as those described in our previous publications (Hulse et al., 2017; 
Hulse et al., 2016). Briefly, male C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were surgically implanted 
with  a  light- weight,  stainless  steel  ring  using  dental  cement.  A  stainless  steel  reference  wire  was 
implanted over the cerebellum for LFP silicon probe recordings. The locations of future craniotomies 
for  probe  and  whole- cell  recordings  were  marked.  Probe  recording  coordinates  were  anteriopos-
terior  (AP)/mediolateral  (ML):  –1.7/1.75  in  the  left  hemisphere  for  DG;  AP/ML:  –1.7/2.0  in  the  left 
hemisphere for CA1; and AP/ML: –2.15/0.84 in the right hemisphere for CA3. Whole- cell recording 
coordinates were: AP/ML: –1.7/0.65 in the left hemisphere for DG; AP/ML: –1.9/1.5 in the left hemi-
sphere for CA1; and AP/ML: –2.15/3.1 in the right hemisphere for CA3. All coordinates are reported 
in mm, all AP and ML coordinates are with respect to bregma. Following surgery, mice were returned 
to their home cage, maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle, and given access to food and water ad 
libitum. Ibuprofen (0.2 mg/mL) was added to the water as a long- term analgesic. Mice were given at 
least 48 hr to recover before the day of the experiment.

Exposure surgery
On the day of the recording, while mice (4–8 weeks old) were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane and 
head- fixed  in  the  stereotaxic  apparatus,  two  small  craniotomies  (~200–500  µm)  were  made  at  the 
previously marked locations and the dura was resected over these locations. A recording chamber 
was secured on top of the head- fixation device and filled with pre- oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2),

filtered (0.22 μm) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO3, 10 
Dextrose, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, and 1.0 NaH2PO4. The procedure was carried out ~6 hr 
before recordings began. To control for the effect of same day anesthesia exposure on the recordings, 
in two mice the dura resection procedure was carried out 3 days before the recordings and the mice 
were habituated to head- fixation on the spherical treadmill for 2 days.

Awake, in vivo recordings
Awake,  in  vivo  electrophysiological  recordings  were  carried  out  following  previously  described 
methods  (Hulse  et  al.,  2017;  Hulse  et  al.,  2016).  Mice  were  head- fixed  on  a  spherical  treadmill 
secured on an air table (TMC). A single- shank, 32- site silicon probe (NeuroNexus) with 100 μm site 
spacing  was  inserted  in  the  coronal  plane  (~15°  angle  pointing  toward  the  midline)  to  a  depth  of 
2600–3400 μm and was adjusted for reliably recording LFP ripple oscillations in CA1. To find the rough 
target depth of whole- cell recording, at first juxtacellular recordings (Pinault, 1996) were performed 
with pipettes filled with aCSF. Whole- cell patch- clamp recordings were performed with a blind- patch 
approach (Margrie et al., 2002; Pinault, 1996) in current clamp mode after the target depth had been 
identified. Pipettes had a resistance of 5–8 MΩ and were filled with an internal solution containing (in 
mM): 115 K- Gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 NaCl, 10 Hepes, 0.1 EGTA, 10 Tris- phosphocreatine, 5 KOH, 13.4 
Biocytin, 5 Mg- ATP, and 0.3 Tris- GTP. The internal solution had an osmolarity of 300 mOsm and a pH of 
7.27 at room temperature. Pipettes are pulled from borosilicate capillaries (OD: 1.0 mm, ID: 0.58 mm; 
Sutter Instrument Company) using a Model P- 2000 puller (Sutter Instrument Company) and inserted 
into the brain in the coronal plane with a~15° angle pointing away from the midline. Recordings were 
made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). The Vm was not corrected for liquid junc-
tion potential. Capacitance neutralization was set prior to establishing the GΩ seal. Access resistance 
was estimated online by fitting the voltage response to hyperpolarizing current steps (Hulse et al., 
2016). The input resistance was estimated by subtracting the access resistance from the ratio of the 
change in Vm produced by the current step over the magnitude of injected current.

Signal acquisition
All electrophysiological signal acquisition was performed with Labview (National Instruments). Elec-
trophysiological signals were sampled simultaneously at 25 kHz with 24 bit resolution using AC (PXI- 
4498, internal gain: 30 dB, range: +/-316 mV) or DC- coupled (PXIe- 4492, internal gain: 0 dB, range: 
+/-10 V) analog- to- digital data acquisition cards (National instruments) with built- in anti- aliasing filters 
for extracellular and intracellular/juxtacellular recordings, respectively.

Histology and imaging
To  identify  the  recorded  neurons,  histology  and  imaging  were  performed,  as  previously  described 
(Horikawa  and  Armstrong,  1988;  Hulse  et  al.,  2017;  Hulse  et  al.,  2016).  Following  the  experi-
ment, mice were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane, decapitated, and the brain extracted to 4% 
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were fixed at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and transferred 
to 0.01 M (300 mOsm) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) the next day. Up to one week later, brains 
were  sectioned  coronally  (100  μm)  on  a  vibrating  microtome  (Leica),  permeabilized  with  1%  Triton 
X- 100 (v/v) in PBS for 1–2 hr, and incubated overnight at room temperature in PBS containing avidin- 
fluorescein (1:200, Vector Laboratories), 5% (v/v) normal horse serum (NHS), and 0.1% Triton X- 100. 
Sections were rinsed in PBS between each step. The next day, sections containing biocytin stained 
neurons were identified on an inverted epifluorescent microscope (Olympius IX51) for further immu-
nohistochemical processing. Sections underwent immunohistochemical staining against calbindin (CB) 
and parvalbumin (PV) to aid locating the recorded neurons in the hippocampus. Sections containing 
biocytin- stained neurons were first incubated in blocking solution containing 5% NHS, 0.25% Triton 
X- 100, and 0.02% (wt/v) sodium azide in PBS. Next, slices were incubated in PBS containing primary 
antibodies against CB (Rabbit anti- Calbindin D- 28k, 1:2000, Swant) and PV (Goat anti- parvalbumin, 
1:2000,  Swant)  overnight.  After  thorough  rinsing  in  PBS,  slices  were  incubated  in  PBS  containing 
secondary antibodies CF543 donkey anti- rabbit (1:500, Biotium) and CF633 donkey anti- goat (1:500, 
Biotium).  Processed  slices  were  rinsed  and  mounted  in  antifading  mounting  medium  (EverBrite, 
Biotium). Stained slices were imaged on an inverted confocal laser- scanning microscope (LSM 710 & 
LSM 880, Zeiss).

Data analysis
Vm decomposition
Spikes were detected by identifying local maxima in the broadband membrane potential with peak 
prominence  of  at  least  15  mV  and  width  of  at  most  10  ms.  Cells  with  spike  thresholds  exceeding 
–37  mV  were  considered  to  be  possibly  damaged  and  were  therefore  excluded  from  subsequent 
analyses. The subthreshold membrane potential (Vm) was computed by interpolating the membrane 
potential over periods with an action potential starting from 3ms before to 5ms after the spike peak. 
The subthreshold Vm signal was then low- pass filtered (Parks- McClellan optimal equiripple FIR filter, 
250–350 Hz transition band) and downsampled to 2083 Hz. The Vm signal was decomposed into fast, 
slow, and drift components as follows. First, the slow Vm component (Vm,slow) was obtained by median 
filtering  Vm  with  a  1  s  window.  Next,  the  fast  Vm  component  (Vm,fast)  was  obtained  as  the  residual 
Vm  after  subtraction  of  Vm,slow.  A  drift  component  (Vm,drift)  was  obtained  by  smoothing  Vm,slow  with  a 
60  s  boxcar  kernel.  Finally,  Vm,slow  was  detrended  by  subtracting  Vm,drift,  which  included  the  resting 
membrane potential as well as any Vm changes on the timescale of minutes (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 3). By construction Vm = Vm,fast + Vm,slow + Vm,drift and the components contain different frequency 
bands of the subthreshold membrane potential.

Ripple detection
Ripples were detected as transient increases in power in the ripple frequency band of the LFP from 
the  probe  site  located  in  the  CA1  pyramidal  cell  layer.  Ripple  power  was  estimated  by  band- pass 
filtering the LFP trace (80–250 Hz), smoothing its square with a Gaussian kernel (10 ms), and taking 
the square root. Candidate ripple events were identified as segments for which the ripple power was 
more than 3 s.d. above the mean. Segments that were less than 55ms apart were merged, and after 
the merging step segments of length less than 20 ms were rejected as artifacts. A reference recording 
site away from the CA1 cell layer that does not exhibit ripples was identified and the same procedure 
was applied for ripple detection on this reference channel. Events detected in both the CA1 and the 
reference LFP trace were rejected as artifacts.

Current source density (CSD) estimation
Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from a 32- site silicon probe with 100 µm site spacing posi-
tioned so that sites spanned all of neocortex, area CA1, the DG, and parts of the thalamus. LFPs were 
bandpass filtered between 1 Hz and 1 KHz and downsampled to 2083 Hz. Channels with recording 
artifacts  were  excluded  from  the  CSD  analysis.  Laminar  current  source  densities  were  estimated 
with  ~17  µm  resolution  using  a  robust  version  of  the  one- dimensional  inverse  CSD  spline  method 
(Pettersen et al., 2006). In particular, the forward matrix (relating CSDs to LFPs) was computed as 
usual,  but  the  inverse  matrix  (relating  LFPs  to  CSDs)  was  computed  using  ridge  regression  with  a 
regularization  parameter  set  by  a  cross- validation  procedure.  The  spatial  smoothness  of  the  CSD 
estimate was automatically controlled by the regularization parameter and therefore no further spatial 
smoothing  was  applied.  The  anatomical  laminae  in  CA1  and  DG  were  determined  using  a  combi-
nation of histological reconstruction of the probe track, electrophysiological markers (ripples, sharp 
waves, and dentate spikes), and the CSD covariance structure. DG CSD activity was computed by first 
averaging the rectified CSD signals from the vertical extent (~200 µm) of the suprapyramidal molec-
ular layer of DG (giving the ‘rectified DG CSD’), then smoothing with a 1 s median filter, and finally 
converting to a z- score. By construction DG CSD activity only reflects the rate and magnitude of tran-
sient synaptic activity and not any slow- varying (<1 Hz) transmembrane currents which are inherently 
difficult to capture with AC- coupled recordings (Brankack et al., 1993). Using DG CSD activity, we 
identify UP states as time periods when the rate and amplitude of EC input current transients, rather 
than  the  DC  level,  increases,  in  accordance  with  previous  publications  (Isomura  et  al.,  2006).  We 
further validated that the extracted UP/DOWN states reflect modulation of pupil radius and ripple 
rate, quantities that are independently measured.

Transfer model estimation
Linear transfer models were estimated after taking the z- scored DG CSD activity as model input and 
the slow Vm component of the subthreshold membrane potential of a given cell as output. The FIR 
was estimated from the input- output data using a regularized nonparametric procedure (impulseest

in Matlab System Identification Toolbox with tuned and correlated 'TC' kernel used for regularization) 
(Chen et al., 2012). The input- output data were first downsampled to ~20 Hz and the order of the FIR 
was set to 75, corresponding to 3.6 s duration. The procedure automatically estimated FIR values at 
negative delays (up to –0.86 s) and non- zero filter values at negative delays indicated that the slow Vm 
component led DG CSD activity. Once the impulse responses were estimated the corresponding step 
responses were simulated by feeding the model with a step input. Low order autoregressive with extra 
input (ARX) models were also estimated in a similar manner and led to qualitatively similar results as 
the FIR models (data not shown).

UP and DOWN state segmentation
UDS  were  identified  from  the  z- scored  DG  molecular  layer  CSD  activity  using  a  HMM  (McFarland 
et al., 2011). First, a binary Gaussian mixture was fit to the distribution of DG CSD values (Figure 2C). 
Next, the mixture components were used to initialize the emission probability distributions of a two 
state (UP and DOWN) HMM and then the state transition and emission probabilities were estimated 
from the DG CSD time series data. Finally, the most likely sequence of states given the observed DG 
CSD  time  series,  downsampled  to  4  Hz,  were  computed  with  the  Viterbi  algorithm.  The  resulting 
Viterbi path was used to assign a UDS phase to each time point based on its position relative to the 
nearest UDS transition times. The method was unsupervised and did not require user tuning of any 
model parameters.

Significance testing of UDS modulation
To test whether UP- DOWN state had an effect on subthreshold membrane potential we sampled the 
Vm signal every 2 s (in order to remove any serial correlation between retained samples) and grouped 
the  retained  samples  according  to  UP- DOWN  state.  We  then  compared  the  means  of  the  UP  and 
DOWN groups using a parametric two- sample t- test with unpooled variance and also compared the 
medians using the non- parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test, which yielded consistent results. To test 
whether the variance of the fast Vm component in the UDS was different we used a similar procedure, 
but  the  signal  was  sampled  every  1  s  (since  the  fast  component  decorrelated  faster)  and  the  vari-
ances of the UP and DOWN groups were compared using a parametric two- sample F test, as well as 
a non- parametric two- sample Ansari- Bradley test, which yielded consistent results. To test whether 
UP- DOWN  state  had  an  effect  on  the  firing  rate  of  a  given  cell  we  compared  the  observed  spike 
counts in the UDS against the expected counts given the observed mean firing rate using Pearson’s 
chi- square test of goodness of fit. Finally, to test whether UDS phase had an effect on Vm we grouped 
the sampled signal in 20 bins according to UDS phase and checked if the mean of each group was 
different from 0 using a one- sample Z- test with significance level reduced by a factor of 20 to account 
for the multiple comparisons. Modulation by UDS phase was deemed significant if 5 or more of the 20 
groups had means significantly different than 0.

Adapting recurrent neural population model
When  uncoupled,  the  EC  and  CA3  population  dynamics  follow  the  Wilson- Cowan  type  r- a  model 
studied  in  detail  in  Levenstein  et  al.,  2019.  Briefly,  the  mean  firing  rate  of  the  EC  population  (rec) 
evolves under activity- driven adaptation (aec) according to the equations:

Pupil analysis
Pupil videos were analyzed using DeepLabCut (Mathis et al., 2018). A subset of frames were manu-
ally labeled with 8 points around the pupil and these points were subsequently extracted with Deep-
LabCut  for  the  remaining  frames.  A  core  set  of  points  with  likelihood  >0.7  was  detected  for  each 
frame and a circle was fit using the Taubin SVD- based method for frames with more than 3 core points 
(Taubin, 1991). Blinks were detected as abrupt drops in likelihood across the detected points. Data-
sets with mean likelihood across detected points above 0.95 and with more than 97% valid frames 
were  selected  for  analysis.  Proper  extraction  of  pupil  diameter  and  blinks  was  confirmed  by  visual 
inspection.
