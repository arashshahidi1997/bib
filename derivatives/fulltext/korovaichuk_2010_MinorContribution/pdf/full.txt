Analysis of local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs) helps understand the function
of the converging neuronal populations that produce the mixed syn-
aptic activity in principal cells. Recently, using independent compo-
nent analysis (ICA), we resolved ongoing hippocampal activity into
several major contributions of stratiﬁed LFP-generators. Here, using
pathway-speciﬁc LFP reconstruction, we isolated LFP-generators that
describe the activity of Schaffer-CA1 and Perforant-Dentate excita-
tory inputs in the anesthetized rat. First, we applied ICA and current
source density analysis to LFPs evoked by electrical subthreshold
stimulation of the pathways. The results showed that pathway speciﬁc
activity is selectively captured by individual components or LFP-
generators. Each generator matches the known distribution of axonal
terminal ﬁelds in the hippocampus and recovers the speciﬁc time
course of their activation. Second, we use sparse weak electrical
stimulation to prime ongoing LFPs with activity of a known origin.
Decomposition of ongoing LFPs yields a few signiﬁcant LFP-gener-
ators with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics for the Schaffer and
Perforant inputs. Both pathways convey an irregular temporal pattern
in bouts of population activity of varying amplitude. Importantly, the
contribution of Schaffer and Perforant inputs to the power of raw
LFPs in the hippocampus is minor (7 and 5%, respectively). The
results support the hypothesis on a sparse population code used by
excitatory populations in the entorhino-hippocampal system, and they
validate the separation of LFP-generators as a powerful tool to explore
the computational function of neuronal circuits in real time.

Multiple neuronal populations form a complex system of
local circuits and global networks whose activity constitutes
the basis for information processing in the brain. The electrical
transmembrane currents produced by working neurons are
mixed together and generate local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs), a
macroscopic variable that reﬂects the information processing at
mesoscopic scales. Thus the decoding of LFPs may help us
understand the principles of information handling. To date,
resolving the electrical activity of converging neuronal popu-
lations into the original informative sources remains problem-
atic (Mitzdorf 1985; Nunez and Srinivasan 2006).

Approaches are emerging to analyze LFPs, such as spectral
coherence, principal components, and laminar population anal-
ysis, and these have proven useful to identify important fea-
tures in mixed deep electrical sources (for example, see
Einevoll et al. 2007; Kocsis et al. 1999). Recently we imple-
mented a blind source separation strategy (Makarov et al.
2010) that takes advantage of the spatial immobility of elec-
trical brain sources in the LFP’s time scale. This structural
feature arises from the ﬁxed location of the synaptic afferents
to target cells, producing transmembrane currents whose ex-
tracellular part is circumscribed to the postsynaptic cell. The
approach uses independent component analysis (ICA) to sep-
arate the informative sources (Bell and Sejnowski 1995;
Makeig et al. 2004; Stone 2004), and it allowed us to disen-
tangle intracerebral LFPs recorded in the hippocampal CA1
region into the contributions of a few major LFP-generators
(Makarov et al. 2010). In this study, we present a special
technique that permits the unequivocal association of the LFP-
generators isolated with the presynaptic neuronal populations
and its application to quantify the independent contribution of
Schaffer and Perforant inputs to the total hippocampal LFP.
Thus we have obtained a tool for the parallel readout of the
discrete activities of the working neuronal populations from
standard LFPs.

ICA is a widely used approach to extract spatially distinct
independent sources of activity from mixed signals (for review,
see Choi et al. 2005). Simultaneous multisite recordings are
required to estimate the different impact of several spatially
localized and distant generators into each sensor. This method
has been successfully applied to surface EEG recordings,
whereby deep strongly synchronized neural sources can be
discriminated (Jung et al. 2005), but their spatial localization is
only poorly assessed and it lacks cellular correlates. These
problems are signiﬁcantly diminished when using intracerebral
local recordings, because the signals are generated in the
volume surrounding the array of recording sensors. The paral-
lel arrangement of principal cells and the pronounced stratiﬁ-
cation of inputs in the hippocampus also favor the application
of ICA and interpretation of the results obtained.

Our recent application of ICA to LFPs in the rat CA1
showed several dominant generators of LFPs, producing a
subcellular deﬁnition of their spatial localizations that was
constant across animals (Makarov et al. 2010). A causal rela-
tion between the ﬁring of local units and the activity of speciﬁc
LFP-generators was also shown. This result suggests that each
isolated LFP-generator may have a neuronal origin with dif-

ferent functionality. Indeed, one may expect that the activity of
an afferent input to a restricted dendritic ﬁeld in the principal
cells may be associated with a single LFP-generator disentan-
gled by ICA from the complete LFPs. To test this hypothesis,
here we have used selective electrical stimulation of known
hippocampal pathways such as the Schaffer input to CA1 and
the perforant path (PP) input
to the dentate gyrus (DG).
Selective stimulation elicits evoked LFPs whose well-known
spatial maps are used to crosscheck the ICA-derived LFP-
generators in the ﬁrst part of the study.

Hippocampal evoked potentials are regularly used to explore
the functional properties of neuronal populations. Experimen-
tal and theoretical studies show they are reliable population
indices of the corresponding membrane events in single neu-
rons (Andersen et al. 1971; López-Aguado et al. 2002; Varona
et al. 2000). Evoked synaptic inputs produce inward and
outward currents covering the entire morphology of principal
cells with pathway speciﬁc spatial distribution that can be
precisely determined by current-source density (CSD) analysis
(Freeman and Nicholson 1975; Lorente de Nó 1947). As a ﬁrst
step, we assessed the spatial and temporal performance of the
ICA, as well as its capacity to discriminate different sources
using evoked LFPs of known origin.

Subsequently, we studied spontaneous LFPs primed by ran-
dom sparse subthreshold evoked activity to identify the disen-
tangled components. The presence of evoked and well-known
spontaneous events speciﬁc for each pathway in the raw LFPs,
and in a single LFP-generator, guarantees its correct unequiv-
ocal identiﬁcation. We further quantiﬁed the speciﬁc contribu-
tion of LFP-generators to the global signal during irregular
LFP patterns. Interestingly, the two major excitatory pathways,
Schaffer and PP, contribute little to ongoing LFPs, producing
scarce and irregular bouts of activity.

Experimental methods

Female Sprague-Dawley rats (200 –220 g) were anesthetized with
urethane (1.2 g/kg, ip) and fastened to a stereotaxic device, maintain-
ing their body temperature at 37°C with a heated blanket. The surgical
and stereotaxic procedures performed were described elsewhere (Ca-
nals et al. 2005; Makarova et al. 2008). Concentric bipolar stimulating
electrodes were placed in at least two of the following locations: the
alveus for antidromic activation (from bregma, midline, and cortical
surface AP: (cid:1)5.5, L: 2.6, V: (cid:1)1.8 mm), the ipsilateral CA3 (septal
pole) for orthodromic activation of the CA1 region (AP: (cid:1)3.2, L: 2.6,
V: (cid:1)3.3 mm), and the angular bundle (AP: (cid:1)8, L: 4 –5, V: 3.5– 4 mm)
for orthodromic activation of the granule cell population in the DG.
These points were approached at a 30° angle in the sagittal plane.
Stimuli (0.07– 0.1 ms square pulses, 0.1– 0.8 mA) were applied to
elicit the characteristic evoked potentials, which were used to guide
the placement of recording probes. Linear multisite probes (models:
A1x16-5mm50-177 and A1x32-6mm50-413, Neuronexus Technolo-
gies, Ann Arbor, MI) were lowered into the hippocampus (AP:
4.5–5.5, L: 2–3 mm) and connected to a multiple high-impedance
headstage. The 16-site probes were used to record along the main axis
of CA1 pyramidal cells, whereas the 32-site probes spanned both CA1
and DG/CA3 regions. A silver chloride wire in the neck skin served
as a reference for recording, and the signals were ampliﬁed and
acquired using low-noise MultiChannel System (Reutlingen, Ger-
many) recording hardware and software (50 kHz sampling rate). All
the experiments were performed in accordance with European Union

guidelines (86/609/EU) and Spanish regulations (BOE 67/8509-12
1988) regarding the use of laboratory animals.

Histology

Silicon probes were labeled with DiI (Molecular Probes, Invitro-
gen, Carisbad, CA) by soaking in a 1% solution of N-N-dimethyl-
formamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). At the end of the exper-
iment, animals were perfused transcardially with saline/heparine and
paraformaldehyde (4%). Coronal cryostat sections (15 (cid:1)m) were
obtained and labeled with bis-benzimide (Sigma), and they were
examined under a ﬂuorescence microscope (560 – 610 nm) to identify
the probe position (see example in the Supplementary Fig. S1).1

Usually only a few of them (G1–G6 in the ﬁgure) have signiﬁcant
amplitude and different spatial distributions (voltage loadings). We
noticed that, because of the ambiguity of the ICA (fortunately insig-
niﬁcant for our study), the voltage loadings and activations are given
in arbitrary units (i.e., we can arbitrarily scale the loadings but we
must simultaneously apply inverse scaling to the activations). Once
LFP-generators have been extracted from the raw LFPs, we can
analyze them as if they were active alone. For example, we can
construct virtual LFPs produced by a single generator, say kth, from
its voltage loading and activation

2 Clariﬁcation of terminology. The term source is used with different
implications in ICA and CSD analysis. In the former, source is used in a
comprehensive manner to denote active brain regions (i.e., large zones of
neural activity). Here a source in the ICA sense refers to each of the individual
coherent components of the LFPs. Neither of these should be confounded with
the formal notation of outward transmembrane currents or current sources used
in CSD analysis. For the sake of simplicity, we maintain the latter and adopt
the term LFP-generator for the ICA-derived sources.

FIG. 1. General strategy of local ﬁeld potential (LFP) decomposition and the identiﬁcation of generators. The diagram shows the sequential steps from an
LFP spatial map recorded along the CA1 axis containing evoked responses to a twin pulse in the ipsilateral CA3 (Schaffer response). A similar procedure is
followed for spontaneous LFPs. The simultaneous recording of 16 sites along the main axis of the principal cell (pyramidal neurons) (A) is analyzed by
current-source density (CSD) (B) to obtain the map of inward and outward population currents (sinks are in blue and sources in yellow-red). Multiple membrane
events overlap spatiotemporally. The LFP proﬁle is also analyzed by an independent component analysis (ICA) that provides a set of 16 generators each with
a temporal activation (C) and spatial distribution (D). Of the 16 generators, only a few (1– 6 in the example) have a signiﬁcant variance, whereas the others are
rejected for analysis. The second spatial derivative of the spatial weight curves (or voltage loadings) provides the CSD loadings (E), a spatial index that reﬂects
the distribution of membrane currents along the conductor. Because the ICA does not ensure the correct polarity or absolute values of amplitude, we reconstructed
the LFP for each generator isolated (F). Such partial LFPs regain the correct polarity and true amplitude. A CSD can be applied to the reconstructed LFP, which
provides simpliﬁed spatiotemporal maps of inward/outward currents for unique spatially coherent membrane events (G). These maps can be compared with the
CSD of raw LFPs (curved dashed arrow) to ﬁnd speciﬁc membrane events buried within the mixed CSD (closed dashed white lines). It can be shown that the
spatial proﬁles of partial CSDs (E) match the spatial proﬁle of the CSD loadings (small dashed arrow) and hence their true polarity is assessed. Arrowheads mark
the time of stimulus (artifacts have been removed for analysis). a.u., arbitrary units.

Figure 1F shows LFPs contributed by G6 only. Note that the ICA
ambiguity does not affect the virtual LFPs, i.e.: the reconstructed
LFPs are dimensional. The virtual LFPs can be used to evaluate the
CSD created by a single generator (Fig. 1G shows the CSD of G6),
and thus the raw and generator-based CSDs can be compared (Fig. 1,
B and G). We also noticed that, using Eqs. 1–3, the CSD related to the
kth generator can be evaluated by CSDGk

For the ICA, we made use of the infomax algorithm proposed by
Bell and Sejnowski (1995) and further modiﬁed by Amari et al. (1996)
and Lee et al. (1999). The algorithm is implemented in the EEGLAB
Matlab toolbox (Delorme and Makeig 2004).

Comparison of LFP-generators: Distance measure

Each application of the ICA on LFPs, to either different recordings
or for different time windows, provides several LFP-generators, and
thus we need a method to compare and classify them. Each generator
is characterized by its activation sk(t) and spatial loading Vk (Fig. 1, C
and D). Activations are time speciﬁc and therefore they cannot be
used for comparison. In contrast, the loadings depend on the spatial
distribution of an axon’s terminals and hence they must be similar for

To partition a set of voltage loadings into disjointed clusters, we use
hierarchical clustering based on the introduced distance measure with
the average-linkage algorithm.

Identiﬁcation of stable LFP-generators

An ICA may theoretically isolate as many LFP-generators as the
number of LFP signals (16 or 32 in these experiments), yet obviously,
only a few of them will be statistically signiﬁcant and stable. For

example, in Fig. 1C, the ﬁrst 6 generators have high amplitude and
they are clearly related to the stimulus, whereas the other 10 may
capture noise and therefore they may vary strongly from one record-
ing to another. In our former study (Makarov et al. 2010), we
considered those LFP-generators contributing (cid:3)5% to the total LFP
variance (power) as statistically signiﬁcant. The number of reliable
components that can be extracted in practice depends on many factors
such as the particular region under study, the signal to noise ratio, and
the relative strength and spatial extension of active components. Some
neuronal populations (e.g., hippocampal pyramidal cells) ﬁre very
the
rarely (Ranck 1973; Thompson and Best 1989) and hence,
postsynaptic activity of their targets may contribute little to the total
LFPs. In this study, we consider an isolated LFP-generator with the
variance contribution (cid:4)5% to be signiﬁcant, as long as it is unequiv-
ocally related to a known pathway and provides a clean CSD spatial
map (low noise and a ﬂat baseline). To identify the most stable
LFP-generators in spontaneous LFPs, we used the two-step algorithm
(Makarov et al. 2010). First, we identiﬁed “global” generators through
an ICA of a sufﬁciently long recording (tens of seconds). Second, we
divided the same recording into short-term contiguous epochs (each 1
s long), and we applied an ICA to each of these segments. We expect
that stable strong LFP-generators should be presented in all epochs,
whereas noisy, unstable, temporal or weak generators will ﬂuctuate,
and hence, their spatial loading will differ from epoch to epoch. We
identiﬁed those that are most stable over time by calculating the
similarity measure (4) between the “global” and “local” generators.

the same spatial distribution as deﬁned by the axon’s terminals. Thus
two types of LFPs with the same spatial characteristics must be
captured by one and the same LFP-generator, and hence the presence
of evoked responses in the activation of the LFP-generator sk(t) assists
in its identiﬁcation. In preliminary experiments, we found that sub-
threshold ((cid:4)0.5 (cid:5) threshold) stimuli delivered at an average rate of 1
Hz do not signiﬁcantly change the variance of the total signal. We also
found that strong (near threshold and suprathreshold) evoked re-
sponses produce a complex mixture of components when analyzed by
ICA/CSD (see Fig. 1). Apparently such phenomena are not present in
the low-amplitude events of ongoing LFPs, and thus we chose low
stimulus intensities to prevent the generation of PS components (i.e.,
we achieve vanishing recruitment of intrinsic currents into ﬁeld
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) during synchronous acti-
vation, Herreras 1990). For Schaffer activation, we chose stimuli that
produced fEPSPs of (cid:7)0.5 mV in the stratum radiatum, and for the PP
input, the intensity was adjusted to raise a positive ﬁeld in the Hilus
(cid:7)1 mV (below 0.5 mV in the DG molecular layer). To analyze the
LFPs, we used a two-epoch recording: 1) spontaneous and 2) spon-
taneous plus evoked activities. Thus we can examine whether evoked
activity modiﬁes the level of spontaneous activity on the same or
another LFP-generator. In accordance with the stability analysis of the
LFP-generators (Makarov et al. 2010), we found that mixing sparse
subthreshold evoked activity into ongoing LFPs neither modiﬁes their
characteristics nor affects the spatial proﬁles of the LFP-generators, as
long as the probe array remained in place.

Power of LFP-generators

Reconstruction of LFPs for speciﬁc pathways

Analysis of evoked LFPs

Evoked LFPs were recorded for a series of stimuli of varying
intensity (short, 0.1 ms, square pulses at a rate of 0.1–1 Hz), from a
low subthreshold to supramaximal [i.e., producing maximal popula-
tion spike (PS)]. The stimulus intensity was measured in units of the
threshold intensity to evoke a PS and stimulus artifacts were removed,
except where indicated. Each series of evoked LFPs was analyzed as
one long signal containing either all stimuli or selected groups of
evoked responses. Only the period of interest (40 –50 ms) immediately
after the stimulus was analyzed for each proﬁle, and thus intermediate
periods were removed off-line and the time windows containing
responses were concatenated into a continuous unique signal. This
procedure does not affect the applicability of ICA but rather improves
its efﬁciency by increasing the relative variance of the signal of
interest.

Priming of LFPs with evoked activity

To identify the presynaptic populations corresponding to LFP-
generators, we stimulated known afferent pathways with random
sparse subthreshold pulses. The rationale was that the minimal electric
activation of a pathway emulates its spontaneous excitation. Therefore
the evoked and spontaneous activities of a given pathway must have

Reconstructed LFPs recover the correct polarity and provide a good
quantitative estimate of the pathway-speciﬁc variance and power. The
power was calculated in the electrode that showed maximum ampli-
tude during irregular LFP patterns (i.e., excluding theta periods) over
a total of 3 min of 20 s randomly chosen segments within 1 h. A major
advantage of pathway-speciﬁc LFPs is that they provide simpliﬁed
CSD maps describing a unique spatial structure of inward and out-
ward currents. These can easily be matched to those obtained from
customary hippocampal evoked ﬁelds, whose uncomplicated nature
and well-deﬁned distribution along the anatomy of principal cells
assist path identiﬁcation (Herreras 1990; Herreras et al. 1987; Leung
et al. 1995; Lømo 1971).

R E S U L T S

We ﬁrst tested the spatial and temporal performance of the
ICA on evoked LFPs obtained by activation of the Schaffer-
CA1 and PP-dentate inputs. Subsequently, we used the path-
way speciﬁcity of the ICA-derived LFP-generators to explore
the spontaneous population activity of these pathways in on-
going LFPs.

SEPARATION OF ARTIFACTS AND NEURAL ACTIVITY. The capacity
of the ICA to suppress EEG artifacts is well established (see
Castellanos and Makarov 2006; Vigario et al. 2000 and refer-
ences therein), and thus we assess here its applicability to
isolate stimulus artifacts (caused by electric shock) in deep
brain recordings. We antidromically stimulated the CA1 pyra-
midal population from the alveus (Fig. 2A, cartoon inset), and
the electric shock produced a large negative spike-like poten-
tial ((cid:3)40 mV, truncated at the black dot in Fig. 2Aa) that may
reverse polarity outside the hippocampal tissue. This artifact
was followed by evoked LFPs with the characteristic proﬁle of

FIG. 2. Segregation of artifacts and neural activity by the ICA. The ﬁgure
corresponds to the analysis of an LFP obtained during antidromic activation of
the CA1 ﬁeld. The alvear electric shock produced a large voltage artifact (dot
in Aa) followed by an antidromic population spike. The artifact is nearly
deleted in the corresponding CSD (Ab) while locally generated active sink and
passive sources are visible. The ICA showed only 2 signiﬁcant generators (Bb).
G1 contains the stimulus artifact (Ba) that enters all electrodes with similar
weight (ﬂat voltage loading in Ab). G2 contains all
the neural activity,
displaying a bell-shaped voltage loading curve spanning the activated soma-
todendritic domains (Ac). B: the cluster analysis of all voltage loading curves
obtained in 7 animals establishes 2 groups (blue and green) corresponding to
the artifacts and population spikes, respectively. The average spatial loading
curves is shown in Bb (mean (cid:6) SD).

the antidromic PS (Varona et al. 2000). The corresponding
CSD map (Fig. 2Ab) shows the somatodendritic sink (blue,
electrodes 7–11) surrounded by passive sources (yellow/red).
The polarity of currents reverses in the ensuing slower tail, as
expected for somatic recurrent inhibition (active somatic cur-
rents ﬂanked by passive basal and apical dendritic currents).
The ICA successfully isolated the artiﬁcial potential as a
single generator, G1, that was devoid of neuronal activity (Fig.
2, Ac and Ad, blue curves). We noted that the spatial voltage
loading of the artiﬁcial generator is essentially ﬂat (Fig. 2Ac,
blue line). Such a generator, which enters all electrodes at the
same strength or with a linear decay, has a null CSD (Eq. 2),
which means that its origin lies outside the recording zone and
that the generator is volume propagated, as expected. The
second strongest LFP-generator, G2, contains the main part of
the neuronal activity, including the PS and inhibitory currents.
The LFP variance explained by the remaining G3–G16 is (cid:4)5%

(Fig. 2Ae). Thus when evoked LFPs contain a large artifact, the
resolution of the mixed neuronal activity signiﬁcantly deterio-
rates. Hence, in subsequent analysis, we routinely cut off the
stimulus artifacts before applying the ICA.

We found that the results shown in Fig. 2A were stable in all
animals, and the clustering analysis of voltage loadings of all
the LFP-generators in the seven animals provided a well-
deﬁned partition into two groups (Fig. 2Ba; intracluster dis-
tance (cid:4)0.15, intercluster distance (cid:3)0.5). This is evident in Fig.
2Bb, which shows the mean (cid:6) SD spatial loadings for the
artiﬁcial G1 and neuronal G2 generators averaged over load-
ings belonging to the corresponding cluster (n (cid:2) 7).

SUBTHRESHOLD ACTIVATION OF AN AFFERENT PATHWAY IS CAP-
TURED BY A SINGLE LFP-GENERATOR WITH PRECISE SPATIOTEMPO-
RAL DEFINITION. Let us now examine the ICA performance on
LFPs evoked by activation of Schaffer-CA1 and PP-DG inputs
(a detailed description of evoked LFPs and their CSD analysis
can be found in the Supplementary Fig. S1). We ﬁrst studied
the excitatory Schaffer input to the CA1 that was activated by
subthreshold (0.5 (cid:5) threshold) stimuli to minimize the second-
ary intrinsic currents (Herreras 1990). Figure 3A shows raw
proﬁles of evoked LFPs and the corresponding CSD map. It
can be appreciated a single active sink centered in the st.
radiatum, surrounded by two passive current sources in the
soma region and distal apical dendrites.

Application of the ICA identiﬁed 16 LFP-generators, and
only 1 of them, G1, had statistically signiﬁcant amplitude (Fig.
3B). The activation of G1 matches the time course of the raw
LFP at the site of maximum amplitude (electrode 9 in Fig.
3Aa). G1 has a bell-shaped spatial distribution (Fig. 3Bc, blue
curve) that is maximal in the apical dendrites, and its polarity
reverses in the soma layer, in close correspondence to the
spatial proﬁle of LFPs calculated for the time instant marked
by the arrow in Fig. 3Aa (Fig. 3Bc, black line). The spatiotem-
poral dynamics of the CSD obtained from the LFPs recon-
structed from G1 matched the CSD map calculated from the
raw LFP proﬁle (Fig. 3, Be vs. Ab). We noticed that the
three-layered source-sink-source distribution caused by excita-
tory synaptic and return currents was not decomposed by the
ICA into three different components, but rather, it was ex-
plained by the single G1 LFP-generator. The transmembrane
source/sink loop of current raised by a discrete patch of active
membranes is contained within the shape of the spatial weights
of the ICA-isolated LFP-generator (loading vector V1 in Eq. 1).
Similar results were repeatedly obtained in ﬁve animals, and
in a clustering analysis of the loading curves obtained in
different experiments, the interloading distance was (cid:4)0.1 for
all generators (Fig. 3Ca). In one experiment, we obtained two
signiﬁcant generators: one of them (2a in Fig. 3Ca) had a
similar voltage loading as that described above (Fig. 3Bc),
whereas the other (2b in Fig. 3Ca) was signiﬁcantly different.
Hence, in this experiment, it would seem that some spontane-
ous LFP event of a different origin overlapped with the evoked
activity, which was isolated into a separate LFP-generator. The
mean (cid:6) SD voltage loading for the Schaffer synaptic input
averaged over n (cid:2) 5 experiments is shown in Fig. 3Cb.

In a representative experiment that examines PP-DG evoked
responses (Fig. 4), subthreshold (0.5 (cid:5) threshold) activation of
the PP produced the expected negative LFP in the molecular
layer of both blades and a strong positive potential across the

FIG. 3. Precise spatial and temporal performance of ICA on LFPs produced
during subthreshold activation of the Schaffer input to CA1. A: an electric
shock in the ipsilateral CA3 evoked a negative potential in the apical dendritic
tree (a). The schematic neuron indicates the approximate recording position.
The CSD reveals inward currents (sinks) centered in stratum radiatum ﬂanked
by passive sources in the soma layer and stratum lacunosum (b). B: the ICA
applied to the LFP proﬁle shows a unique signiﬁcant component (b) with a
temporal course matching the voltage change in central electrodes (a). C: the
voltage and CSD loadings (blue plots) coincide with the spatial proﬁles of the
raw LFP and CSD (black plots; measured at the instant marked by the small
arrows in A). The CSD calculated for the reconstructed LFP for G1 (c) is
similar to the raw CSD (Ab). D: cluster analysis for voltage loadings obtained
in 4 animals show a unique group (a). The average voltage loading (mean (cid:6)
SE) shown in b was built using the st. pyramidale as a spatial reference.

Hilus (Fig. 4A). The CSD map showed strong sinks in both
molecular layers (sk1, sk2) and a weaker sink (sk3) produced
by CA1 pyramidal cells in the st. lacunosum, in close corre-
spondence to the known anatomical
terminations of these
ﬁbers. Passive sources (return currents) appeared in the GCL
(cartoon in Fig. 4A, right). The ICA of LFPs again rendered
only 1 signiﬁcant LFP-generator, G1 (activation in Fig. 4Ba
and loading in Fig. 4Bd), whereas the other 15 were negligible
(Fig. 4Bb). The CSD map of the virtual LFPs reconstructed for
this unique generator (Eq. 3) matches the CSD of the raw
signal (Figs. 4, Bc vs. A). Likewise the voltage and CSD
loading curves (Fig. 4Bd) match the spatial proﬁles for the raw

signals. Thus one ICA-isolated LFP-generator may contain
synaptic activity from several separate populations, as long as
they are simultaneously activated by a common input.

Qualitatively,

the same results were observed when we
repeated this analysis in ﬁve animals. However, since the
separation between the GC layers varies because of the curved
arrangement of this population, the anatomical normalization
of the recording tracks across animals is not ideal. This pre-
cludes direct comparison of spatial loadings obtained in dif-
ferent experiments. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows the results
from the other four experiments.

SEPARATION OF THE ACTIVITY EVOKED BY MULTIPLE PATHWAYS. Be-
cause of the volume propagation of extracellular currents, a
LFP may contain activity from several domains within the
same neurons or even from different distant populations and at
a distance from the recording electrode. Thus we tested
whether the ICA can decompose LFPs with a contribution from
two pathways into the original Schaffer and PP inputs to the
CA1 and DG, respectively.

Conveniently, the pyramidal and granule cell populations
are spatially segregated, and they can be covered by different
groups of electrodes in the 32-site linear probe. In the two
representative experiments shown in Fig. 5, a series of sub-
threshold paired pulses of stimuli were delivered at a rate of 0.2
Hz rate to the Schaffer and PP pathways. These pathways were
either stimulated with a 100 ms delay or simultaneously (left
and right columns in Fig. 5, respectively). The stimulus inten-
sity was maintained constant for the Schaffer input, whereas
for the PP input, it increased over time for noncoincident pairs
of stimuli (Fig. 5A) and decreased for the coincident pairs (Fig.
5B), yet always remained below a 0.5 (cid:5) threshold. The LFPs
recorded for the two stimulus conﬁgurations by the 32-site
linear probe extended from the CA1 st. oriens to the lower
GCL can be seen in Fig. 5A (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for
greater detail).

NONCOINCIDENT STIMULI. An electric shock in the ipsilateral
CA3 produces the Schaffer fEPSP in CA1, as well as a local
multiphasic ﬁeld in the CA3/DG. The CSD map shows the
characteristic source-sink-source distribution of currents along
the CA1 pyramidal cell axis and a local source-sink dipole
(Fig. 5B, Sch). This latter dipole contains a mixture of the
antidromic sink in the area of the granule cell and of the local
recurrent orthodromic fEPSPs in CA3 (this local response may
contain PP activation in other experiments, depending on the
position of the stimulating electrode). Activation of the PP
pathway produced an excitatory sink in the molecular layer
(100 (cid:1)m above the CA3 sink), as well as the corresponding
somatic sources in both GCLs (Fig. 5B, PP). A weaker sink
was also observed in the st. lacunosum of the CA1 region.

The ICA of the LFPs yielded three signiﬁcant LFP-genera-
tors, G1–G3, with little if any cross-contamination (Fig. 5C).
Noticeably, the time course of G1 activation shows increasing
pulses in agreement with the increasing amplitude of the PP
stimuli. In addition, the beginning of the G1 pulses coincides
with the onset of the stimuli in this pathway. The other two
LFP-generators, G2 and G3, exhibit pulses of constant ampli-
tude (as for the Schaffer stimulation), whose onset coincide
with the beginning of the stimulation to the Schaffer input.
Thus the LFP-generator G1 exclusively represents the activity
in the molecular layer of the DG (cf. Fig. 4), whereas the

FIG. 4. Precise spatial and temporal performance of the
ICA on LFPs produced during subthreshold activation of the
entorhinal input to the dentate gyrus (DG). A: an electric shock
in the ipsilateral perforant path (PP) evoked a negative poten-
tial in both molecular layers of the DG. A sample record from
electrode 13 of a 32-site probe is shown in a. The raw CSD (b)
shows active sinks in both molecular layers (sk1 and sk2) and
a weaker sink in the st. lacunosum of the CA1 (sk3). Passive
sources can be appreciated in the granule cell layers (GCL).
The schematic neurons show the approximate site of record-
ings. B: the ICA applied to the LFP proﬁle shows a unique
signiﬁcant component (b) with a temporal course matching the
voltage change in the molecular layer (a). The CSD calculated
for the reconstructed LFP for G1 (c) is similar to the raw CSD
(Ab). The voltage and CSD loadings (d) coincide with the
spatial proﬁles of the raw LFP and CSD. Note that a unique
ICA component captures coherent activity in physically sepa-
rated cell generators as long as they are synaptically activated
by a common input.

CA3-evoked LFPs were decomposed into two generators: G2
responsible for the Schaffer-mediated CA1 excitation (cf. Fig.
3) and G3 corresponding to the local CA3/DG activation. The
CSD maps of the virtual LFPs reconstructed from each of the
isolated generators (Fig. 5D) also conﬁrm the pathway and
population speciﬁc nature of the LFP-generators. Therefore
ICA provides an accurate decomposition of multiple inputs that
are not temporally coincident.

In principle, the tight temporal coinci-
COINCIDENT STIMULI.
dence of multiple sources decreases the efﬁciency of ICA to
separate them. Thus we checked its performance on two
precisely synchronized different inputs. When the stimuli were
delivered simultaneously to the Schaffer and perforant path-
ways (Fig. 5, right column), there seemed to be a complex
mixture of the sources and sinks in the raw CSD map. Notably,
the proximity of the CA3 and GC layers led to fusion of their
respective sinks into a unique slightly drifting sink (Fig. 5B),
which made the sinks indistinguishable and complicated its
direct interpretation.

Even in this case, the ICA still rendered three signiﬁcant
LFP-generators. Each of the generators had voltage loadings
similar to those found in the noncoincident case (Fig. 5C, left
vs. right), although their separation was less effective. As such,
the strongest LFP-generator, G1, responsible for the PP input,
introduced some contamination into the other two. This cross-
contamination could be appreciated by comparing the loading
curves in the left and right columns. We noticed that in the
lower part of the loading curve (DG/hilus) for the Schaffer G2
(arrow pointing to red curve), there was a spatial weighting
analogous (disregard the polarity) to that of the PP-speciﬁc G1
generator (arrow pointing to blue curve). The CSD maps for
the reconstructed LFPs (Fig. 5D) show that
the Schaffer-
speciﬁc G2 generator contains some current belonging to the
CA3 and FD regions (left vs. right columns in Fig. 5D).
Nevertheless, even in this extreme case of the perfect time
coincidence of different inputs, the speciﬁc activations of the
LFP-generators conﬁrm an adequate separation. Indeed, only
G1 exhibits decaying amplitude of activation in agreement
with the decaying intensity of the stimulus applied to the PP
input, whereas G2 has stationary amplitude in agreement with
constant stimulation of the Schaffer pathway. All these results
were reproduced in four additional animals.

Schaffer and PP population activity in ongoing LFPs

We showed that ICA can separate Schaffer and PP evoked
activities mixed in LFPs, and we described their spatiotempo-
ral characteristics. Neither of the spatial weight curves (load-
ings) for these pathways matched those found in our former
study, which described the most powerful generators in spon-
taneous LFPs (Makarov et al. 2010). This observation suggests
that the LFP-generators describing the activity induced by the
excitatory pathway may contribute weakly to the spontaneous
LFPs. Thus we sought after the LFP-generators for the Schaf-
fer and PP inputs in ongoing LFPs by mixing in subthreshold
stimuli that facilitate the identiﬁcation of the generators.

IDENTIFICATION OF SCHAFFER AND PP POPULATION ACTIVITIES IN
ONGOING LFPS. A fragment of ongoing LFPs was analyzed
during which both pathways were activated in a random-like
manner at an average rate of 1 Hz each (Fig. 6A). The vertical
dashed red and blue lines mark the onset of the Schaffer and PP
stimuli, respectively. Because of the weak intensity of the
electrical stimulation, the evoked responses are hardly discern-
ible in the raw LFPs. By applying an ICA, we found ﬁve main
LFP-generators (Fig. 6, B and C), two of which exclusively
contain the evoked responses to the Schaffer (G2) and PP (G4)
stimuli (Fig. 6C). We noticed that the activations of the other
LFP-generators (G1, G3, and G5) did not correlate with the
onset of the stimulus, indicating that there was little if any
cross-contamination between these generators. The remarkable
speciﬁcity of the activities contained within G2 and G4 (Fig.
6B) was proof that both are truly independent and well-isolated
LFP-generators responsible for the Schaffer and PP inputs,
respectively. The shape of the voltage loadings (spatial weight
curves) for G2 and G4 are essentially identical to those found
in experiments where only evoked activity was assessed (cf.
Fig. 6C, red and blue curves to Figs. 3Bc and 4Bd, respectively,
and also to Fig. 5C, red and blue curves). The portion of the
variance explained by the two primed pathways (bars in red
and blue) is small ((cid:4)5%; Fig. 6D). This reduced contribution
of the Schaffer and perforant pathways to LFPs makes their
identiﬁcation in ongoing spontaneous LFPs extremely difﬁcult.
As such, LFP-generators containing their activities fall below
the level of signiﬁcance and hence they can be overlooked.

LULAR SPECIFICATION. Disentangling the raw LFPs into LFP-
generators enables the reconstruction of virtual LFPs produced

by a speciﬁc pathway during ongoing activity and their sepa-
rate analysis. An example is shown in Fig. 7 for an LFP
fragment containing three evoked (subthreshold) pulses (ap-
plied to Sch or PP pathways; the onset of each is marked by a
dashed line in Fig. 7A). The LFP was recorded from the
pyramidal/oriens border in CA1 to the lower blade of the DG.
The corresponding CSD map shows a confusion of sources and
sinks produced by the ongoing spatiotemporal activity of
different origins (Fig. 7B).

The ICA of the LFP fragment rendered ﬁve LFP-generators
(Fig. 7C), and their spatial loadings and time course of activa-
tion can now be used to identify pathway-speciﬁc evoked
activity. By searching for the evoked responses among all

generators and comparing their activations and voltage load-
ings to those shown in Fig. 6, B and C, respectively, we
identiﬁed G2 and G4 as responsible for the Schaffer and
perforant inputs, respectively. Because of the ambiguity of the
ICA (see METHODS), the time course of the activations is given
in arbitrary units and is not directly comparable. However, we
can reconstruct the virtual LFPs created by each single gener-
ator. Figure 7D shows LFPs reconstructed for the Schaffer
generator (G2). The spontaneous population activity and two
of the evoked events can be tracked down in the raw signal.
The reconstructed evoked potential proﬁle shows no difference
to its raw counterpart, as expected (see the ellipses in Fig. 7, A
and D, ampliﬁed in the right insets). By visual inspection of the
raw and Schaffer reconstructed LFPs, it is patent that ongoing
raw LFPs are most prominent in the hilus of the DG (lower
electrodes), whereas Schaffer mediated activity is more con-
spicuous in the CA1. Also some activity in the CA3/DG region
that is probably caused by recurrent excitation of presynaptic
pyramidal cells in the CA3 region.

As further conﬁrmation of the speciﬁcity of the Schaffer
generator (G2) identiﬁed, we compared its activation (Fig.
7B, G2) with the high-frequency activity ((cid:7)100 –200 Hz)
associated to sharp waves, an electrographic event known to
be caused by synchronous activation of the CA3 region (i.e.,
Schaffer-mediated: Buzsáki et al. 1983). Indeed, the speciﬁc
bouts of activity contained within the Schaffer G2 generator
were coherent with ripple-like fast activity in the CA1
perisomatic LFPs (black top trace in Fig. 7B; band-pass:
100 –500 Hz).

To obtain the precise localization and magnitude of the
underlying transmembrane currents, we evaluated the CSD of
the reconstructed LFPs (Fig. 7E). As expected, the Schaffer
population activity presented a main sink in the st. radiatum
surrounded by passive sources (return currents) in the st.
pyramidale and lacunosum, matching the locations of the
well-known CSD map for evoked Schaffer activity (Fig. 3).
The CSD maps of isolated pathway-speciﬁc LFPs contrasted
with those obtained for the mixed signal (cf. Fig. 7, B and E).
It is worth mentioning that the temporal activation of isolated
components corresponds to that of the population synaptic
currents (e.g., compare the evolution of the CSD map at

FIG. 5. Discrimination of multiple evoked synaptic inputs in mixed LFPs.
Subthreshold stimuli were applied to both the ipsilateral CA3 (Schaffer) and
the PP, either as paired pulses (100 ms delay, left column) or synchronously
(right column). PP stimuli were modulated in intensity, whereas CA3 stimuli
were constant. A: raw LFPs recorded along a track spanning the CA1 and
CA3/DG up to the lower GCL. B: CSD maps for a sample response (raw CSD)
to either the PP, the CA3 (Sch), or both. Schematic neurons between panels
show the approximate locus of recording. PP produced a main sink in the st.
moleculare (sk1) and a weaker sink in the CA1 st. lacunosum (sk2). CA3
activation raised a sink in the CA1 st. radiatum (sk3) and a local sink (sk4).
Combined stimuli produced a complex sink in the DG (sk5) and the Schaffer
sink in CA1 (sk6). C: the ICA yielded 3 signiﬁcant generators in both cases. G1
and G2 correspond to the PP and Schaffer generators, respectively, whereas G3
corresponds to local activity in the CA3/DG. The top traces show the time
activation and the bottom traces show the corresponding spatial voltage and
CSD loadings. Note that activations vary in G1 with successive stimuli,
whereas they remain constant in G2, precisely reﬂecting the intensity applied
in each case. The spatial loadings for G1 and G2 were identical as when each
pathway was stimulated alone. A small contaminant appeared during coinci-
dent stimulation (small arrows). D: virtual CSD maps for sample responses of
each separate generator. Note the spatial coincidence of the separate virtual
sinks with those in the raw LFPs.

Identiﬁcation of the Schaffer and PP population activities in ongoing LFPs. A: segment of raw LFPs recorded from the CA1 st. pyramidale to the lower
GCL in the DG. LFPs were primed with subthreshold stimuli applied in a random manner to the CA3 (Sch) and PP. The vertical dashed lines mark the timing
of stimulation (blue for PP and red for CA3). Evoked potentials are short and small, and hence, they do not introduce much variance in the raw signals (they
are hardly discernible over this time scale). B–D: the ICA yielded 5 principal generators, 2 of which speciﬁcally contain the activation corresponding to the
evoked potentials for the Schaffer (G2) and the PP (G4). B: an ampliﬁcation of the responses after each stimulus. Note the pathway speciﬁc segregation of evoked
responses in the corresponding generators. The spatial loadings shown in C match those found for nonprimed LFPs (G1, G3, G5) or for separately stimulated
pathways (G2, G4). D: relative variance of the generators isolated.

electrodes 8 –9 in Fig. 7E to the corresponding activation in
Fig. 7C, red trace). Thus LFP-generators isolated by the ICA
enable the population-speciﬁc transmembrane current density
to be examined, rejecting contamination of the other inputs in
ongoing LFPs.

MINOR CONTRIBUTION OF EXCITATORY PATHWAYS TO HIPPOCAM-
PAL LFPS. The Schaffer and PP generators (G2 and G4) iden-
tiﬁed that describe the activation of the corresponding path-
ways enabled the spontaneous activity of these pathways to be
studied and quantiﬁed (i.e., the presynaptic CA3 and entorhinal
afferent populations, respectively). In general, we found that
the spontaneous activity (during irregular LFPs) of both the
Schaffer and PP generators represents an irregular pattern of
short bouts over a rather ﬂat baseline. These can be appreciated
in a sample epoch in Fig. 8A along with their respective
wavelet spectra. They lasted a few hundred milliseconds, had
variable amplitude and occurred at (cid:4)1 Hz rate. Smaller and
shorter events can also be appreciated, which may be physio-
logically relevant. The main frequency content of the activity
concentrates in the 0.5– 4 Hz range for both generators. To
track the evolution of the generator’s power over time, we
calculated time envelopes of this activity (see METHODS and Eq.
6), where large events and baseline activity can be better
distinguished (Fig. 8B).

The dimensional power (measured in mV2) that contributed
to the ongoing LFPs for each synaptic pathway can be esti-
mated from the virtual LFPs reconstructed from the corre-

sponding LFP-generators (see METHODS and Eqs. 3 and 5). The
Schaffer and PP inputs produce 0.045 and 0.031 mV2 on
average (7 and 5% of the total power), respectively (Fig. 8C),
whereas the contributions of the other generators ranged be-
tween 0.13 and 0.24 mV2 in four animals. This result corrob-
orates the relatively small contribution of the excitatory path-
ways into the total LFP variance observed above (Fig. 6D), but
now excluding the evoked activity. We also noticed that the
powers of the Schaffer and PP generators have smaller SE
relative to the powers of G1, G3, and G5, which suggests that
the Schaffer and PP inputs described are more stationary in
time and between different animals than the other three
LFP-generators.

Studying the mechanisms of neural information processing
requires certain knowledge of the circuitry and of the causal
and functional associations between activities of different neu-
ronal groups. Here, we showed that an ICA can effectively
separate standard LFPs in the hippocampus into pathway-
speciﬁc isolated activities, called LFP-generators, describing
the inputs of multiple presynaptic populations. The main req-
uisite for the separation is the different spatial distribution of
transmembrane currents along the somatodendritic axis of
principal cells, whereas the temporal pattern of the pathway’s
activation is less important (e.g., they can be rhythmic or
irregular).

found were used to quantify the pathway-speciﬁc contribution
to ongoing LFPs. Hence we have consistently shown in all
studied animals that the contribution of the major excitatory
pathways to the power of ongoing LFP signals is minor ((cid:7)7
and 5%, respectively). We also showed that both Schaffer and
perforant pathways have irregular temporal patterns, with
bouts of population activity of varying amplitude and with the
frequency concentrated in the 0.5– 4 Hz range.

Methodological considerations

A critical consideration regarding the ICA is that the com-
ponents found may have little functional relevance unless
accurate information on their anatomical basis is provided. All
the same, ICA can efﬁciently separate signals coming from
distant point sources (Choi et al. 2005). There are few studies
on ICA of deep brain recordings (Makarov et al. 2010; Tans-
kanen et al. 2005). In deep recordings, the signals generated in
the volume surrounding the electrode array (i.e., the sources or
LFP-generators) are essentially extended spatially, and their
spatial scales may be larger than the interelectrode distance.
However, the same mathematical principles are applicable to
LFP recordings (Makarov et al. 2010). Disentangling such
LFP-generators is based 1) on the coincident activation of
individual homologous ﬁbers over the millisecond time scale
and 2) on their different spatial distributions. The ﬁrst condi-
tion provides the necessary synchronization of homologous
axons to raise signiﬁcant macroscopic synaptic ﬁeld potentials,
the main contributors to normal LFPs (Mitzdorf 1985; Nunez
and Srinavasan 2006). The second condition is ensured by the
distinct distributions of afferent axons from different afferent
populations. The accuracy of the spatial resolution is therefore
optimized to the subcellular level of the active neurons. We
showed that the spatial CSD-loading curves of the Schaffer and
PP LFP-generators match the conﬁguration of the inward and
outward currents for known membrane events (Andersen et al.
1971; Herreras 1990; Kandel et al. 1961). Admittedly, some
factors can modify the expected spatial pattern of ﬁeld poten-
tials, such as the heterogeneous electrical properties of the
conducting medium, spatial cancellation, and frequency scal-
ing of currents in the volume conductor (Bédard et al. 2004;
López-Aguado et al. 2001; Makarova et al. 2008). In earlier

The ellipse marks a Schaffer evoked response enlarged to the right. Note the

5 main generators separated by the ICA. G2 and G4 correspond to the Schaffer and
PP generators, respectively. Note the characteristic spatial voltage loadings on the
right. The top (black) trace corresponds to the ﬁltered (100 –500 Hz band-pass)
LFP recorded from the CA1 soma layer. Note that epochs of fast oscillations
coincide with the bouts of activity in the Schaffer generator (G2), matching the
features of sharp wave events. D: reconstruction of the Schaffer-speciﬁc LFP. This
virtual LFP now contains only the virtual LFP corresponding to ongoing activation
of the CA3 to CA1 input. The ampliﬁcation on the right shows the virtual fEPSP
for a sample Schaffer response. Note that all evoked and spontaneous activity
undergo changes of identical polarity for a given electrode. E: virtual CSD map for
the ongoing Schaffer activity. Schaffer evoked sinks and sources are now like the
standard evoked responses (compare. with the raw CSD in B).

experimental and modeling work, we reported some particular
cases where some of these may be relevant (López-Aguado et
al. 2001, 2002; Makarova et al. 2008; Varona et al. 2000). Such
studies cannot easily be extrapolated on the distribution of
LFP-generators. Because this analysis was performed on lo-
cally recorded LFPs, we speculate that the factor potentially
most relevant is the mutual spatial cancellation between indi-
vidual synaptic inputs when these are scattered through ex-
tended dendritic domains (Makarova et al. 2010). The excita-
tory Schaffer and PP inputs are strongly stratiﬁed; hence we
would not expect a strong bias introduced by this factor either.
This approach is not dependent on the presence of rhythmic
activity or stereotyped LFP events, and hence it can be applied to
a wide variety of behaviors. Indeed, all the examples shown in this
report were chosen among epochs of irregular activity, whose
behavioral correlates are very rich (Jarosiewicz and Skaggs 2004).
In neuroscience, ICA is frequently used to suppress artifacts in
EEG recordings (Castellanos and Makarov 2006). We showed
that artifacts caused by electric shocks within brain tissue can also
be isolated and suppressed by the ICA. However, strong artifacts
((cid:7)100 times higher than the neuronal activity) decrease the
efﬁciency of the ICA for the simultaneous separation of other
mixed components of neuronal origin. Hence we suggest that
artifacts should be removed before performing an ICA.

The weak contribution of the Schaffer and perforant pathways
to ongoing LFPs makes their identiﬁcation extremely difﬁcult
(i.e., LFP-generators can be overlooked). Therefore we used
selective low-magnitude electrical stimulation of the known ex-
citatory pathways to ensure the reliable identiﬁcation of LFP-
generators describing the activity of these pathways. Thus the
identiﬁcation was based on 1) a comparison of spatial voltage
loadings of the LFP-generators found for evoked responses with
those found for ongoing LFPs and 2) the recognition of evoked
pulses in the time courses of LFP-generators obtained by ICA of
composite epochs (i.e., a recording consisting of 2 epochs: spon-
taneous LFPs and spontaneous plus a few evoked LFPs).

The polarity of the CSD loading is essential to deﬁne whether
an LFP-generator describes excitatory or inhibitory input. How-
ever,
the ICA cannot unequivocally determine this feature
(Hyvärinen and Oja 2000). Although this problem is hard to solve
for spontaneous LFPs and requires special biophysical assump-

tions (Makarov et al. 2010), we found that mixing sparse sub-
threshold evoked potentials in LFPs can be used to resolve the
problem. The presence of evoked pulses in the time course of an
LFP-generator is related to the stimulated neuronal population,
and it helps identify the correct polarity. The subsequent applica-
tion of CSD analysis on virtual LFPs reconstructed from a single
generator enables the resultant partial CSD map to be directly
compared with the raw CSD and with CSD maps of well-known
evoked responses of speciﬁc pathways. It is worth noting that
CSD map of isolated generators show no alternations in terms of
the current’s sinks and sources, as expected for a speciﬁc synaptic
input. In contrast, raw CSD maps may contain such alternations
because of the spatiotemporal mixing of the activities of several
generators and DC ﬁltering (Brankacˇk et al. 1993).

When and what can an ICA discriminate in LFPs?

To correctly interpret LFP-generators isolated by an ICA, it
is relevant to ask whether each of them corresponds to postsyn-
aptic activity from one or several neuron types. This problem
is simpliﬁed greatly by the use of linear probes in the hip-
pocampus where each subﬁeld has only one type of principal
cell: namely pyramidal and granule cells. Each synaptic input
produces loops of inward/outward currents with a different
spatial distribution within the same core conductor. Typically
the maximum potential is attained at the center of the synaptic
contact made by the isolated pathway (Herreras 1990). How-
ever, distant recording sites also contain activity, albeit of
reduced magnitude. Therefore steadily correlated recording
sites correspond to anatomical subdomains of one type of
principal cell, whereas the subcellular precision can be
achieved through a CSD analysis of the distribution of spatial
weights in isolated generators. This procedure enables the
separation of inputs into a single population according to
known stratiﬁcation along the dendritic arbor.

However, when linear recording probes extend through several
subﬁelds (e.g., CA1 and DG/CA3), the interpretation may not be
that trivial because of volume propagation of currents and/or the
simultaneous activation of populations in both subﬁelds. The
electrical ﬁelds created by two physically separated cells extend
beyond their respective physical limits, mixing in local record-

ings. This is not a handicap for this approach because the temporal
activation for each generator has no spatial dimension (i.e., it
contains the coherent activity of a group of electrodes regardless
of their location). Accordingly, the CSD examination shows
whether the activity can be circumscribed to one or several
physically separated cell generators. In this study, we found that
the two excitatory generators seem to have true activity in more
than one region. Thus the activity of the entorhino-hippocampal
pathway (PP) was contained in only one LFP-generator, but it was
divided between both blades of the DG. The parsimonious expla-
nation is that the presynaptic population activates two or more
physically separate target populations through bifurcating axons,
in agreement with anatomical and electrophysiological ﬁndings
(Hjorth-Simonsen and Jeune 1972; Lømo 1971). Hence, activa-
tion is identical and simultaneous in both blades, and thus it can be
described by a single LFP-generator isolated by the ICA. With
regard to the Schaffer generator, although CA3 activation ren-
dered a single component in CA1 whose spatial loading curve
matches the termination of Schaffer collaterals (Herreras 1990),
prominent activity was also obtained near the stimulating
electrode in the CA3/DG. The origin of this local activity
varied somewhat in different experiments and was most
commonly found in the molecular layers of the DG for
evoked responses, probably because of backﬁring of the PP
ﬁbers (Wu et al. 1998). During spontaneous LFPs,
the
CA3/DG activity associated to the Schaffer generator is less
prominent, and it most likely reﬂects the synchronous ac-
tivity of CA3 pyramidal cells because of recurrent excitation
in this area (Miles and Wong 1987). Thus the CA3 pyrami-
dal population is presynaptic for both CA1 and itself, and
therefore the ongoing activity in the Schaffer generator
should appear simultaneously in both regions, as happens to
be the case.

Excitatory currents contribute little to hippocampal LFPs

Some LFP events and rhythmic oscillations have been studied
intensively, and the neuronal circuits producing them have there-
fore been clariﬁed. For example, sharp hippocampal waves are
known to be mediated by the excitatory input from CA3 to CA1
populations (Buzsáki et al. 1983). Here, we also observed a
correlation between sharp waves and the ICA isolated Schaffer
generator describing the synaptic activity produced by CA3 py-
ramidal cells in CA1. Some LFP events, such as the theta rhythm,
have a mainly inhibitory origin (Soltesz and Deschenes 1993),
whereas others are still under study, such as gamma oscillations
(Csicsvari et al. 2003; Mann et al. 2005), fast ripples (Ylinen et al.
1995), and dentate spikes (Bragin et al. 1995). In light of the
proportion of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocam-
pus (Aika et al. 1994), the small contribution of the major
excitatory pathways to hippocampal LFPs might seem unexpected
(Schaffer and PP generators explain 7 and 5% of the power,
respectively). The other three LFP-generators show a signiﬁcant
phase-spike relationship, with (cid:7)60% of the putative interneurons
in CA1 (Makarov et al. 2010), suggestive of their inhibitory nature
(i.e., the corresponding synaptic currents are produced by local
inhibitory circuits). Circumstantial data in the literature argue in
favor of the dominance of inhibitory over excitatory currents in
ongoing population activity (Hajos et al. 2000; Herreras et al.
1988; Oren et al. 2010), although direct evidence is scarce. The
dominance of inhibitory currents was found in synaptic noise

recorded from membranes of cortical pyramidal cells (Rudolph et
al. 2005; see also Anderson et al. 2000; Borg-Graham et al. 1998).
Besides the ﬁring rate of several types of interneurons in the
hippocampus is much higher than that of pyramidal cells (Somo-
gyi and Klausberger 2005). Along with the functional coordina-
tion of some interneuron networks (Whittington et al. 1995), the
hypothesis that inhibition prevails over excitation in hippocampal
LFPs becomes more plausible. Nonetheless, the precise percent-
age of excitatory contribution to LFPs found here may vary in the
freely moving animal, because anesthesia modiﬁes the overall
pattern of LFPs (Brankacˇk et al. 1993; Buzsáki et al. 1986).

In any case, the results presented here point to a very low output
rate of CA3 pyramidal cells during irregular LFPs, in agreement
with previous data (Ranck 1973; Thompson and Best 1989). In
terms of the PP generator, the overall behavior was similar
(occasional synchronous bouts of irregular activity), again indi-
cating a low output rate from entorhino-hippocampal projection
cells during irregular patterns of LFP. The presynaptic origin of
this generator is suggested by the limited evoked responses after
PP stimulation. The identity of the entorhinal projecting cells is
not clearly established in the literature, and difﬁculties may arise
from the fact that the entorhino-hippocampal projection is multi-
farious. Unitary studies have not clariﬁed this issue, because most
interest has focused on the relationship of entorhinal units with
theta (Alonso and Llinás 1989; Chrobak and Buzsaki 1994;
Frank et al. 2001). Thus stellate and pyramidal-like cells have
been deemed candidates for this projection. Indeed, interesting
functional data supporting the identity of the PP generator
shown here is that the bouts of activity are not related to
hippocampal sharp waves (Chrobak and Buzsaki 1994), which
is consistent with the poor temporal correspondence between
bouts of activity in the Schaffer and PP generators.

To conclude, we propose the combined use of ICA and CSD
as a high-resolution method for the subcellular identiﬁcation of
LFP components in regular structures and for the quantiﬁcation
of their ongoing activity.
