Abstract Hippocampal firing is organized in theta sequences controlled by internal memory
processes and by external sensory cues, but how these computations are coordinated is not fully
understood. Although theta activity is commonly studied as a unique coherent oscillation, it is the
result of complex interactions between different rhythm generators. Here, by separating
hippocampal theta activity in three different current generators, we found epochs with variable
theta frequency and phase coupling, suggesting flexible interactions between theta generators. We
found that epochs of highly synchronized theta rhythmicity preferentially occurred during
behavioral tasks requiring coordination between internal memory representations and incoming
sensory information. In addition, we found that gamma oscillations were associated with specific
theta generators and the strength of theta-gamma coupling predicted the synchronization between
theta generators. We propose a mechanism for segregating or integrating hippocampal
computations based on the flexible coordination of different theta frameworks to accommodate
the cognitive needs.

Introduction
The hippocampal formation flexibly combines computations subserving spatial navigation, driven by
external environmental cue stimuli (McNaughton et al., 1983; O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978), but also
memory processing, dependent on internally generated firing sequences (Pastalkova et al., 2008;
Wang et al., 2015). The characteristic oscillatory activity patterns in brain networks have been pro-
posed as a mechanism to organize different computations and, depending on the cognitive needs,
integrate or segregated them in oscillatory cycles (Buzsa´ki and Draguhn, 2004; Engel et al., 2001;
Lisman and Jensen, 2013). In the hippocampus, theta and gamma oscillations are the most promi-
nent rhythms recorded in freely moving animals (Buzsa´ki, 2002; Colgin, 2016; Colgin, 2013; Van-
derwolf, 1969). Theoretical and experimental work in the hippocampus have associated the
processing of environmental cues and the encoding of memories with the input from the entorhinal
cortex (EC) arriving at CA1 at a particular phase of the theta cycle, and the retrieval of memories
with the CA3 output to CA1 in a different phase of the cycle (Douchamps et al., 2013;

eLife digest In the brain, a vast number of neurons coordinate their activity to support complex
cognitive processes. One of the best places to see this in action is the hippocampus, a brain
structure with a key role in memory and navigation.

The hippocampus shows waves of electrical activity, which represent the synchronized firing of

large numbers of neurons. The hippocampus can generate multiple rhythms at once. The two main
rhythms are theta and gamma. Theta waves are slow, with a frequency of about 8 Hertz. Gamma
waves are faster with a frequency of up to 120 Hertz or even more.

Theta waves are always present in the brains of freely moving animals, whereas gamma waves

occur in brief bursts. These bursts usually correspond to a particular point on the theta wave. One
burst may occur just before each peak of the theta wave, for example, whereas another burst may
occur just after the peak. This separation enables individual bursts of gamma to carry different
messages without them becoming mixed up. This is similar to how radio stations broadcast their
signals at different carrier frequencies to avoid interference.

By recording hippocampal activity in rats exploring a maze, Lopez-Madrona et al. now show that

the hippocampus has not one, but three generators of theta waves. Having three sources of theta,
each of which can be synchronized with gamma, provides a more versatile system for encoding and
sending information. It also means that the three theta generators can vary the degree to which they
coordinate their firing. This helps the brain combine or separate streams of information as required.
By working together to create a single theta rhythm, for example, the three theta generators can
help animals combine information stored in memory with incoming sensory input.

How the coordination of theta rhythms in the hippocampus influences the activity of other brain
regions involved in learning and memory remains unclear. However, uncoupling of theta and gamma
waves seems to be an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease and can also be seen in the brains of people
with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Understanding how this process occurs could
provide clues to the origin of these disorders.

Hasselmo et al., 2002; Siegle and Wilson, 2014). Information transmission between these regions
is proposed to occur in gamma oscillations of different frequencies organized in the phase of the
slower CA1 theta rhythm (Colgin et al., 2009; Lisman and Idiart, 1995; Lisman and Jensen, 2013).
These theta-gamma associations, known as cross-frequency coupling (CFC), are modulated during
exploration and memory-guided behaviors (Cabral et al., 2014; Canolty et al., 2006; Colgin, 2015;
Ferna´ndez-Ruiz et al., 2017; Laszto´ czi and Klausberger, 2016; Laszto´ czi and Klausberger, 2014;
Schomburg et al., 2014; Tort et al., 2008). Recent studies have further shown that theta-gamma
interaction may vary in a cycle-by-cycle manner within a global hippocampal theta rhythmicity
(Dvorak et al., 2018; Lopes-Dos-Santos et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). However, theta oscilla-
tions originating in different anatomical

(Alonso and Garcı´a-Austt, 1987; Bland and Whishaw, 1976; Buzsa´ki, 2002; Charpak et al., 1995;
Green and Rawlins, 1979; Vanderwolf C et al., 1973; Kramis et al., 1975; Montgomery et al.,
2009; Vanderwolf, 1969; Winson, 1974) and, therefore, theta-gamma interactions need to be
interpreted in the context of multiple rhythm generators.

In addition to the classical medial septum/diagonal band of Broca input imposing a global rhyth-
micity to the hippocampus and EC, important rhythm generators are located in EC layers II (EC2)
and III (EC3), whose activity reach the dentate gyrus (DG) and hippocampus proper through the per-
forant and temporoammonic pathways, respectively, and from CA3 activity reaching CA1 stratum
radiatum through the Schafer collaterals (Buzsa´ki, 2002). Importantly, although theta oscillations in
the hippocampus are most commonly studied as a unique coherent oscillation across hippocampal
layers, exhibiting a characteristic amplitude/phase vs. depth variation (Buzsa´ki, 2002), the frequency
and phase of the CA3 theta rhythm generator was shown to change relatively independently from
the EC theta inputs (Kocsis et al., 1999; Montgomery et al., 2009). How these multiple theta
rhythm generators and pathway-specific gamma oscillations interact in the hippocampus is not well
understood. One appealing possibility is that different theta oscillations may represent different

theta-gamma coding frameworks, providing the substrate to segregate, but also to integrate
computations.

Here we investigated the function of pathway-specific synchronization of oscillatory activity in the
hippocampus of rats freely exploring known and novel environments and resolving a T-maze. Using
high density electrophysiological recordings aided by source separation techniques we characterized
the dynamic properties of three different theta and three different gamma dipoles in the hippocam-
pus with origins in the CA3 Schaffer collateral layer, the EC3 projection to the stratum lacunosum-
moleculare and the EC2 projection to the mid-molecular layer of the DG, respectively, and found
strong support for the existence of different theta-gamma frameworks. Using optogenetic tools tar-
geted to CA3 parvalbumin interneurons, we show the specific modulation of the CA3-associated vs.
the EC-associated theta generators, demonstrating independent theta oscillations in the hippocam-
pus. Nevertheless, phase shifts between the identified theta frameworks served to coordinate them
in pairs or triads,
in a sub-second timescale. We then characterized theta-gamma interactions
between the different pathways and established an association with the synchronization state in the
hippocampal network. Theta-gamma CFC was stronger during higher theta synchronization and we
found that pathway-specific gamma oscillations consistently precede theta phase shifts. Finally, we
investigated the functional role of these theta-gamma frameworks for contextual learning requiring
the update of an existent memory with the changes found in the environment. We found that both,
theta-gamma CFC and the coordination between theta oscillations, were consistently higher during
mismatch novelty and memory guided decisions, in situations in which the representation of the con-
text from memory is compared against the incoming sensory information.

Results

Pathway-specific theta and gamma oscillations
We performed electrophysiological recordings using linear array electrodes across the dorsal hippo-
campus in five rats (see Materials and methods, Figure 1). Recordings were carried out while the ani-
mal freely explored a familiar open field (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), a novel open field (Figure 6) or a
T-maze (Figure 7). Using spatial discrimination techniques to separate LFP sources contributed by
different synaptic pathways, based on independent component analysis (ICA, Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 1; Benito et al., 2014; Ferna´ndez-Ruiz and Herreras, 2013; Herreras, 2016;
Herreras et al., 2015; Le˛ ski et al., 2010; Makarov et al., 2010; Makarova et al., 2011;
Ortun˜o et al., 2019; Schomburg et al., 2014), we dissected three robust components in all subjects
(Figure 1; Materials and methods). The maximum voltages (Figure 1b) and dipoles in the current
source density (CSD) depth profiles (Figure 1c) of the three components matched the stratified dis-
tribution of known terminal fields in the hippocampus and the currents resulting from stimulation of
the corresponding pathways, as previously shown (Benito et al., 2014; Ferna´ndez-Ruiz and Herre-
ras, 2013; Laszto´ czi and Klausberger, 2014; Schomburg et al., 2014). The first component was
located in the stratum radiatum, where the CA3 Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway targets the
CA1 region (labelled as Schaffer component or Sch-IC). The second matched the EC3 projection in
the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (lm-IC), and the third one the perforant pathway from EC2 to the
mid-molecular layer of the DG (PP-IC). These three components, referred to as pathway-specific
LFPs or IC-LFPs, represent the synaptic contributions with distinct anatomical origins recorded in the
LFP (Herreras, 2016).

The power spectra of these signals exhibited a clear peak at theta frequency (6–10 Hz) and
broadband gamma activity (Figure 1e). CA3 and EC3 neurons have been shown to fire phase locked
to discrete gamma band oscillations in the downstream Sch-IC and lm-IC, respectively (Ferna´ndez-
Ruiz et al., 2012a; Schomburg et al., 2014), with gamma oscillations segregated in the phases of
the theta wave recorded in CA1 (Colgin et al., 2009; Laszto´ czi and Klausberger, 2014;
Schomburg et al., 2014). In good agreement, pathway-specific gamma activities were distributed in
the theta cycle, with lm-IC close to the theta peak (p radians) and followed by Sch-IC (Figure 1f),
showing consistency with the firing properties of principal neurons in their respective upstream affer-
ent layers. Similarly, entorhinal principal cells in EC2 and EC3 were shown to fire in anti-phase, rela-
tive to the theta oscillation (Mizuseki et al., 2009) and, accordingly,
large amplitude gamma
oscillations in PP-IC and lm-IC in our recordings were found shifted 180˚ (Figure 1f). These results

support the use of multichannel recordings and source separation tools to investigate interactions
between theta and gamma current generators in multiple layers of the hippocampal formation.

The relative phase and coherence of these components was first compared with the theta oscilla-
tion recorded at the pyramidal layer of CA1, commonly used as the reference for temporal interac-
tions in the hippocampus. We measured coherence and the inter-cycle phase clustering index (ICPC)
which, in addition to a measure of coherence, computes the phase differences between signals in a
cycle by cycle basis (see Materials and methods). All IC-LFPs exhibited prominent coherence with
the LFP signal mainly in the theta range (and its first harmonic, Figure 1g). Similarly, the coherence
at theta frequency was high between IC-LFP pairs (0.41, 0.31, 0.61, for Sch-lm, Sch-PP and lm-PP,
respectively, Figure 1g), being larger between EC-associated generators (p<0.0001, ANOVA with
degrees of freedom corrected by Greenhouse-Geisser, F(1.091, 4.363)=89.33). To illustrate the con-
tribution of source separation analysis (ICA) to these results, we compared the coherence between
IC-LFPs against that of LFP signals recorded at the site with the maximum contribution to each IC-
LFP (i.e. str. radiatum, lacunosum-moleculare and hilus for Sch-IC, lm-IC and PP-IC, respectively;
Figure 1g, dashed lines). This comparison revealed higher coherence between raw LFPs at different
frequency bands, likely due to volume conduction between channels, not present in the IC-LFPs. For
the theta band, the differences were most evident in the stratum radiatum, where theta coherence
was significantly lower between IC-LFPs (Figure 1g). Differences were also notable in the gamma
bands for all regions, which will be relevant in further analysis below. Note at this point that the
extraction of highly coherent signals is perfectly compatible with ICA. This methodology finds com-
ponents that are spatially distributed, and only requires small differences in their temporal co-varia-
tion (i.e. temporal jitter and/or amplitude variation). Therefore, ICA allows the separation of sources,
even if there is a high coherence between them (Makarova et al., 2011; see Materials and
methods).

The coherence results were confirmed by the ICPC analysis, demonstrating a significant coupling
in the theta range with the reference LFP signal (ICPC = 0.50/0.73/0.61 for Sch-IC/lm-IC/PP-IC vs.
CA1 LFP, respectively, p<0.0001, surrogate test), which also showed the characteristic phase shift
across layers (p/2, 0.8p and 1.1p radians for Sch-IC, lm-IC and PP-IC, respectively; Figure 1h). Inter-
estingly, the lack of coherence closer to the unit between theta oscillations in the IC-LFPs was
already suggesting the coexistence of different theta current generators with certain degree of inde-
pendency, rather than the artificial breakdown of a unique theta rhythm into spatially segregated
components. In the latter, the coherence between the oscillations should be maximum, as they
would be three components of one single wave.

Different theta frameworks coexist in the dorsal hippocampus
To provide direct evidence of the independency between theta current generators, we next used an
optogenetic approach (Figure 2). Using a transgenic rat cre line (LE-TG[Pvalb-iCre]2Ottc, NIDA,
USA) and adeno-associated virus (AAV1-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE-hGH, Penn Vector
Core, USA) injected in the dorsal CA3 (Figure 2a), we expressed the excitatory Channelrhodopsin-2
(ChR2) in parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons (Figure 2b, Materials and methods). Animals
(n = 3) implanted bilaterally with optic fibers targeting dorsal CA3 and multichannel electrophysio-
logical recordings as before (Figure 1) were used to test the hypothesis that hippocampal theta gen-
erators can be modulated independently by activating CA3 PV-interneurons and decreasing the
Schaffer collateral output. As shown in Figure 2c–d, blue light illumination (460 nm) in animals
freely-exploring an open field significantly and specifically decreased the power of theta in the Sch-
IC and the corresponding pathway-specific low gamma oscillations. In contrast, the oscillatory activi-
ties (power and peak frequency) in lm-IC and PP-IC were preserved (Figure 2c). This finding was
highly robust across animals (Figure 2e). The modulation of theta power specifically in the Sch-IC
with the preservation of peak theta frequencies in the three generators, conclusively demonstrated
the existence of independent theta oscillators in CA3 and EC.

We next investigated in more detail the functional interactions between the three IC-LFP theta
frequencies. To reduce the error of the theta phase estimation to less than 1% of the theta cycle, we
selected for further analysis only those epochs in which theta power was four times higher than delta
(1–4 Hz) activity (Materials and methods and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 for a mathematical val-
idation of this threshold). As expected from the results in Figure 1g and h, theta interactions
between pathways were not constant in time, but presented periods of high and low synchronization

time up to 0.75 s.
The online version of this article includes the following figure supplement(s) for figure 2:

Figure supplement 1. Representative values of ICPC in one animal along time.

(Figure 2f). To get insight into these states, we computed a dynamic ICPC for each theta cycle, mea-
suring the variation of the phase relationship between theta oscillations with respect to the previous
and consecutive cycles (Materials and Methods, Figure 1—figure supplement 3). The dynamic ICPC
was measured for all pairs of IC-LFPs and for the three signals simultaneously (Figure 2g, Figure 2—
figure supplement 1). The distribution of the ICPC over all animals showed a peak close to perfect
phase locking, but with an important tail of low-synchronized epochs, with approximately the 20% of
the cycles presenting an ICPC lower than 0.8. Again, the highest synchronization was found between
PP-IC and lm-IC, in agreement with the coherence analyses (Figure 1g) and consistent with the likely
origin of these generators in two sublayers of the same cortical regions (EC). As we did for the
coherence analysis, we also computed the ICPC from the raw LFP signals recorded at str. radiatum,
lacunosum-moleculare and hilus. This analysis showed significantly higher estimates of phase cou-
pling based on LFPs than for IC-LFPs (averaged ICPC = 0.88/0.93 for the three IC-LFPs/raw LFPs,
p<0.01, paired t-test, t = 5.35, N = 5). Perfect phase locking (ICPC = 1) was strongly reduced in IC-
LFP signals, unveiling the spurious coupling measured on the raw LFPs likely due to the mixture of
sources by volume conduction. Therefore, by separating the sources, ICA allowed us to clearly iden-
tify shifts in theta synchronization across hippocampal layers.

In the previous analysis, we used three consecutive theta cycles to compute the ICPC. We took
this value as a trade-off between time resolution and a robust estimation of the metric. However,
recent works have demonstrated that theta dynamics in the hippocampus may rapidly change
between single cycles (Dvorak et al., 2018; Lopes-Dos-Santos et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). To
overcome this limitation and understand better the temporal dynamics of the theta couplings, we
analyzed the variability of the ICPC across time by comparing the value of a given cycle to that of
the previous ones (Figure 2i). These results provided a monotonously rising curve up to 0.75 s; from
there on, the curve hardly increased. This indicates that the coupling strength between consecutive
cycles spreads on a time scale in the order of one second, thus expecting dynamical changes in the
ICPC in this time scale. Overall, this methodology allowed the characterization of the temporal syn-
chronization between theta generators with a time resolution of one theta cycle, highlighting dynam-
ical changes in the coupling strength between hippocampal pathways in the theta range.

Theta-gamma CFC reflects pathway-specific interactions
The above results supported the coexistence of different temporal frames in the theta range to
organize hippocampal activity. Thus, since gamma activity is nested to the theta cycle, it opened the
possibility to multiple theta-gamma interactions (Figure 3a). For comparison, we first followed a con-
ventional approach to the analysis of theta-gamma phase-amplitude CFC, taking as a phase refer-
layer, as is usually done (Colgin, 2015;
ence the theta in the LFP recorded in the pyramidal

Tort et al., 2008), and using the modulation index (MI) introduced by Tort et al., 2008 (Figure 3b).
This analysis identified the typical coupling between CA1 theta and a slow gamma band of CA3

theta phase and the gamma amplitude at a single specific frequency (gamma reference: slow/medium/fast gamma for Sch-IC/lm-IC/PP-IC). The
location and width of the rectangles indicate the theta phase at which gamma amplitude is coupled, and the color indicates the MI (color scales at the
bottom of each column). Theta waveforms (black traces) are extracted as the average of all theta cycles in the corresponding signals. The highest CFC
strength (red rectangle) was always found between theta and gamma oscillations of the same pathway. (d) Maximum theta-gamma CFC corresponds to

stronger MI values were found in all cases when theta phases were calculated from the corresponding pathway-specific generators, in contrast to pyr
CA1 LFP, and when theta and gamma oscillations had the same origin (*/**p<0.05/0.01, one-way ANOVA of repeated measurements between MI with

molecular layer of the DG overlapping the terminal field of EC2 inputs, compatible with the previ-
ously found theta-gamma CFC in the DG (Bragin et al., 1995). We then computed the CFC using as
references the different theta oscillations separated in the IC-LFPs. The key new finding was the sys-
tematic observation of stronger theta-gamma CFC in IC-LFPs vs. LFPs (Figure 3b). We further tested
the robustness of these phase-amplitude CFCs by using the alternative methodology proposed in
Canolty et al., 2006 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), obtaining similar results. The result was not
totally unexpected, since we had found that the theta oscillation recorded in the LFP and typically
used as a reference in CFC analysis was indeed a mixture of different theta generators of variable
coherence (see Figure 2d–e above).

It has been argued that, in the case of low gamma frequencies in the hippocampus, the measured
theta-gamma CFC could be a spurious effect due to the asymmetry in the theta wave
(Belluscio et al., 2012; Cole and Voytek, 2019; Cole and Voytek, 2017) and/or theta harmonics
(Juhan et al., 2015; Lozano-Soldevilla et al., 2016). This limitation, however, can be mitigated by a
definition of the theta oscillation that takes into account its asymmetry instead of just applying a
band-pass filter at theta frequency (Belluscio et al., 2012; Cole and Voytek, 2019; see Materials
and methods). We checked the effect of theta asymmetry in our dataset with a multiple linear
regression analysis, where the power at each gamma band was determined by theta power and
asymmetry (Colgin, 2016; Zheng et al., 2015; Figure 3—figure supplement 2). We also included
running speed as it has been shown to co-vary with the power and frequency of hippocampal
gamma oscillations (Ahmed and Mehta, 2012; Zheng et al., 2015). We considered two factors to
measure theta asymmetry: the ratio between the duration of rise and decay phases in each cycle and
the ratio between the duration of the peak and the trough (Cole and Voytek, 2018; see Materials
and methods). The analysis confirmed the influence of theta power and speed on gamma power
(Zheng et al., 2015; Figure 3—figure supplement 2), and a negligible contribution of theta asym-
metry. This result supports the existence of a genuine low-gamma activity band in CA1
(Colgin et al., 2009; Dvorak et al., 2018; Laszto´ czi and Klausberger, 2014; Schomburg et al.,
2014; Tort et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2019) and the physiological value of its coupling with the
theta oscillation.

We finally asked whether pathway specific gamma activities were preferentially coupled to the
theta oscillation in their same afferent pathway, likely reflecting local computations, or in different
pathways, thus reflecting inter-pathway interactions, or both. Results in Figure 3c–d demonstrated a
dominant CFC between oscillations recorded in the same IC-LFP. Therefore, theta-gamma CFC
mainly reflects pathway-specific interactions, rather than a unique carrier theta wave to which the
gamma activity from different origins is multiplexed in segregated theta-gamma channels. The
higher theta-gamma CFC found by using pathway-specific theta references, provided yet another

High theta-gamma CFC is associated to synchronization between theta
frameworks
Having shown that theta generators can be modulated independently and present variable syn-
chrony (Figure 2) and gamma nesting is pathway-specific (Figure 3), we next explored the theta and
gamma features accounting for the different synchronization states. We found that theta power in all
IC-LFPs correlated with the ICPC, with larger theta power associated with states of higher synchroni-
zation (Figure 4a, b and c). Interestingly, the frequency of the theta oscillation was constant across
synchronization states in the Sch-IC, but varied in the two EC-associated generators (Figure 4a).
Theta frequencies in lm-IC and PP-IC increased with ICPC (Figure 4b and c). Regarding gamma
activity, broadband power did not correlate with theta synchronization (not shown), in contrast to
narrowband power (slow/medium/fast gamma for Sch-IC/lm-IC/PP-IC, respectively), which correlated
with the ICPC in lm-IC, but not in Sch-IC nor PP-IC (Figure 4b).

Because running speed also correlates with hippocampal theta power and frequency (Vander-
wolf, 1969), we performed a multiple linear regression analysis including running speed, theta
power and theta frequency as explanatory variables to predict the ICPC (Figure 4c). This analysis
allowed us to estimate the contribution of each variable to the ICPC that cannot be accounted by
any other variable in the model. We used for the analysis all theta cycles recorded while animals
were exploring a familiar open-field. The MI was not included in the multiple linear regression since

not with Sch-IC nor PP-IC. CFC in all pathway-specific generators increased with ICPC (R = 0.71/0.82/0.77, p<0.01/0.05/0.001, respectively). Correlations

its value for individual theta cycles is not reliable. The result demonstrated the main effect of theta
power on the ICPC value, with a lower, but significant, contribution of theta frequency and running
speed (Figure 4c, p<0.05, t-test against zero between beta values of each factor, Bonferroni cor-
rected, Materials and methods).

Finally, this analysis unveiled a striking correlation between the CFC and theta synchronization
(Figure 4b and d). Strong theta-gamma modulation was associated with high ICPC values, while
weak or nearly absent CFC was found in periods of low synchronization. Note that, as mentioned
above, only cycles with high theta power activity were selected in this analysis (Figure 4d), so that
signal’s power could not affect the estimation of its phase (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), thus
preventing the introduction of any bias in the synchronization measurement (Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 2, Materials and methods). This result indicated that within-pathway CFC was associated to
the synchronization between pathways.

Gamma oscillations consistently precede theta waves
Theta and gamma oscillations reflect the extracellularly added excitatory and inhibitory synaptic and
active dendritic currents of two processes occurring at different timescales (Herreras, 2016). We
hypothesize that CFC may reflect a mechanism through which fast excitation-inhibition interactions
organize the activity of principal cells in different theta frameworks found in our analysis. We then
looked for an indication of directionality in the interaction between the two frequencies, and com-
puted the cross-frequency directionality index (CFD; Jiang et al., 2015), based on the phase-slope
index to compute the phase difference between two signals. This methodology was specially devel-
oped to estimate the directionality between signals with large differences in signal to noise ratio, as
theta and gamma frequencies, demonstrating in these conditions to be more efficient than classical
approaches such as Granger Causality (Granger, 1969; Jiang et al., 2015; Nolte et al., 2010). In
CFD, an increase of the phase difference between the theta phase and the gamma amplitude with
frequency gives rise to a positive slope of the phase spectrum (i.e. a positive CFD value) when the
phase of the slow oscillation consistently precedes the amplitude of the fast, this is, when the time
difference between a theta phase and the next burst of gamma activity is constant. The slope is neg-
ative when the amplitude of the fast oscillation consistently precedes the phase of the slow or, in our
analysis, when the delay from the gamma activity to the next theta cycle is constant. As shown in
Figure 5a for the group data, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 for individual animals, CFD
resulted in negative values (amplitude-phase coupling, APC) for the specific gamma bands nested to
the theta oscillations in the corresponding IC-LFPs. This gamma amplitude to theta phase direction-
ality is given by the consistent anticipation of the gamma activity to the theta phase. In Figure 5b,
there is a representative example of the gamma-to-theta directionality in PP-IC. The delay from
gamma to theta is almost fixed, while in the opposite direction (theta to gamma) is highly variable. It
should be noted that the CFD is not exempt of limitations and, as the CFC, the presence of harmon-
ics and theta asymmetries may result
in spurious measurements of directionality (Lozano-
Soldevilla et al., 2016).

To validate the finding, we also computed the CFD directly in the LFP signals recorded in the dif-
ferent hippocampal layers. To compare with the IC-LFPs, we chose the LFP signals from the channels
matching the site of maximum contribution to each IC-LFP (Figure 5c and d). Negative values of
CFD were found in the LFPs in str. lacunosum-moleculare and in the DG, supporting the driving role
of gamma oscillations over the phase of the theta waves. We could not find a significant

Figure 5. CFD analysis reveals that gamma activity modulates the phase of theta. (a) CFD analysis of the pathway-specific signals demonstrates
maximum negative values (APC) for those pairs of theta-gamma oscillations with the highest CFC (encircled area). These results suggested that gamma
oscillations modulate the theta phase. (b) Example of gamma-to-theta coupling in the PP-IC. The time difference from the maximum of gamma activity
to the theta peak is almost fixed (APC, blue arrows), while the distance from theta to gamma varies in each cycle (phase-amplitude coupling, PAC; red
arrows). (c) Same CFD analysis as in (a) using the raw LFPs from different hippocampal layers confirmed the APC directionality. (d) Comparison between
CFD values using IC-LFPs and LFPs showed convergent results, with IC-LFPs outperforming the raw signals (*p<0.05, paired t-test across subjects
between IC and LFP values for each IC-LFP separately, t = 3.99/2.98/4.59 for Sch-IC/lm-IC/PP-IC, N = 5).

directionality in the case of the str. radiatum LFP and, in all cases, the absolute value of the CFD was
higher using IC-LFPs than LFPs (Figure 5d), demonstrating that source-separation tools outperform
the use of raw LFPs to investigate pathway interactions. Overall, our CFD analysis suggests that the
neuronal circuits supporting gamma oscillations in the hippocampus set the timing of principal cells
activity in the theta range, as reflected in the phase of the recorded theta oscillations.

Behavioral modulation of theta-gamma CFC and theta synchronization
Previous studies have shown that both CFC and inter-regional coherence, independently, correlate
with learning (Canolty et al., 2006; Engel et al., 2001; Fries, 2015; Fries, 2005; Palva et al., 2005;
Tort et al., 2009; Tort et al., 2008). Our analysis (Figure 4) now showed that both phenomena seem
to be linked. Therefore, in our final set of experiments, we looked for behavioral evidence in support
of the hypothesis that they are part of a common mechanism to flexibly integrate or segregate neuro-
nal computations. More specifically, we hypothesized that layer-specific interactions would phase-lock
theta oscillations between layers to facilitate the integration of CA3-mediated and EC-mediated infor-
mation streams in CA1; for instance, in learning conditions requiring the comparison of context repre-
sentations from memory (Sch-IC pathway) and from the environment (lm-IC and PP-IC pathways;
Buzsa´ki and Moser, 2013; Dudai and Morris, 2013; Wang and Morris, 2010).

One such learning conditions is mismatch novelty (Lever et al., 2006), in which the subject is re-
exposed to a previously visited context which has been modified. The ‘mismatch’ occurs when com-
paring the expected representation from memory and the found representation in the environment.
To test whether ICPC and CFC increase in parallel during mismatch novelty, we trained the animals in

(Figure 6a novelty, see Materials and methods). We computed and compared theta synchrony and
CFC between the novelty session and the habituation session the day before. When the animal
entered the arena, the ICPC between theta oscillations was high and comparable in both conditions
during the first two minutes of exploration (Figure 6b, t1). As the animal explored the context, syn-
chronization remained high during novelty, but rapidly decayed in the known environment (Figure 6b,
t2). Consistent with the notion of information transmission to update an existing memory, by the end
of the exploration time both conditions decreased to the same level of theta synchronization
(Figure 6b, t3), when the introduced tactile stimulus had lost its novelty. As a control, we tested loco-
motor activity comparing movement velocity between novelty and habituation sessions (Figure 6c),
without finding differences between sessions (p>0.3, t-test, Figure 6c). Therefore, differences in the
ICPC cannot be solely explained by changes in locomotor activity. We used a multiple linear regression
analysis as before, to investigate now the independent contribution of theta power and frequency,
experimental condition (control vs. novelty sessions), running speed and time in the task to the mea-
sured ICPC (Figure 6d). We found that theta power and the experimental condition are the main fac-
tors that contribute to the ICPC value, with other variables such us running speed and time marginally
contributing.

We then computed the CFC index (MI) in the same recordings and found that it paralleled the
changes in theta synchronization during the complete session in both conditions, as shown in
Figure 6b and e. The CFC strength was higher in the three IC-LFPs during the novelty sessions asso-
ciated with the higher theta synchronization, and decreased towards the end of the session in paral-
lel with the ICPC (Figure 6e). Previous studies have shown that CFC in EC pathways preferentially
occurs when the animal is rearing on its hind legs, an exploratory response to novelty (Lever et al.,
2006), which is also associated with increased theta frequency (Barth et al., 2018). To investigate
the potential contribution of rearing behavior to our findings in the mismatch novelty task, we
removed from our recordings the epochs in which animals were rearing on their hind legs and then
reanalysed ICPC and CFC. As shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, the increased theta syn-
chronization between the three IC-LFPs was maintained during novelty in the absence of rearing
epochs. Similarly, the MI was higher during novelty, although more variable, likely reflecting the
decrease in the number of data samples after rearing removal. We concluded that the changes
found in mismatch novelty cannot be solely explained by the rearing behavior. Furthermore, we
measured theta frequency in the complete time series and compared it between control and novelty
conditions, and found a significant decrease for Sch-IC and PP-IC theta frequency in t2 (Figure 6—
figure supplement 2; Wells et al., 2013).

In a second behavioral experiment, a hippocampus-dependent delayed spatial alternation task
was used in which the animal needed to remember the arm visited in the previous trial and to
update the memory with the choice made in the current trial (Ainge et al., 2007; Montgomery and
Buzsa´ki, 2007; Wood et al., 2000), again relying on the interaction between context representa-
tions from memory and from external sensory cues. Rats learned in an 8-shaped T-maze to alternate
between the left or right arms on successive trials for water reward (Figure 7a) until they reached
performances above 80%. In this task, the central arm is associated with memory recall, decision
making and encoding of the current decision (DeCoteau et al., 2007; Montgomery and Buzsa´ki,
2007; Tort et al., 2008; Wood et al., 2000), while neuronal recordings in the side arm are thought
to convey little information to predict behavioral outcomes in the following trial (Pastalkova et al.,
2008; Schomburg et al., 2014). Using this task, previous independent studies showed a phase shift
between theta oscillations recorded in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal layers (Montgomery et al., 2009)
and increased CFC in the CA1 radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare IC-LFPs (Schomburg et al.,
2014) associated to the central arm. Therefore, in this analysis we wanted to validate our hypothesis
finding concomitant increases in theta-gamma CFC and theta ICPC in the central arm, and extend
previous findings by incorporating the PP-IC into the analysis. We computed and compared theta-
gamma CFC and theta synchronization in recordings obtained from the central and side arms in cor-
rect trials, selecting only those epochs were the movement velocity was comparable in both arms
(Figure 7b). We found significantly increased CFC in the central arm for the three IC-LFPs
(Figure 7c). Importantly, concomitant with CFC, we also found an increase in theta ICPC in the cen-
tral arm during the same epochs (Figure 7d and e).

The results of the two behavioral tasks, thus, demonstrate that theta-gamma CFC and theta ICPC
across generators are linked and preferentially occur during memory-guided exploration and

mismatch novelty detection, two conditions in which internally generated memory representations
need to be integrated with the incoming sensory information about external cues. They support the
idea that different theta-gamma frameworks may flexibly coordinate information transmission in the
hippocampus.

Discussion
Overall, our results provide functional evidence supporting independent theta oscillations in the hip-
pocampus whose coordination can be seen as a mechanism to channel information between hippo-
campal layers. Synchronized theta states may bind distributed computations, while less synchronized
theta states may secure relatively independent processing in local circuits (segregation). What might
be the mechanism coordinating theta frameworks? We show that theta phase locking across hippo-
campal
layers is associated with stronger CFC. Furthermore, directionality analysis demonstrates
that band- and pathway-specific gamma activity consistently precede theta waves, possibly contrib-
uting to the synchronization of theta oscillations across layers. We thus hypothesize that the CFC
reflects a mechanism operated by local excitation-inhibition interactions to coordinate neuronal com-
putations in separated theta frameworks. In a network with multiple connected nodes, theta-phase
locking between specific nodes would further contribute to the directionality of the information flow,
habilitating targets between which communication is permitted or prevented in defined time win-
dows. We have provided evidence supporting this hypothesis by showing that CFC and the coordi-
nation between the theta current generators recorded in the hippocampus increase in the
mnemonic process.

Independent theta frameworks
In this work, we have separated the LFP sources contributed by different synaptic pathways using
spatial discrimination techniques based on independent component analysis (Benito et al., 2014;
Ferna´ndez-Ruiz and Herreras, 2013; Herreras, 2016; Makarov et al., 2010; Makarova et al.,
2011). This processing step allowed us to work with a more reliable representation of the local
electrophysiological dynamics, as compared to raw LFPs or CSDs (Martı´n-Va´zquez et al., 2013).
The main drawback of LFPs is the multisource origin of the signals, a blend of dipolar (or quadrupo-
lar) field potentials. While the CSD of multisource raw LFPs avoids the problem of volume conduc-
tion, it does not separate the co-activating current sources in the recorded region, hence the CSD of
pathways targeting the same cells (e.g. CA1 pyramidal cells) overlap and add/subtract, cancelling
each other. In these conditions, the time course of the CSD is a composite one (as it is that of native

LFPs) and cannot be unambiguously assigned to any of the co-activating sources. Therefore, source
separation techniques are necessary to obtain the correct time course of each individual synaptic
contribution.

Extensive previous research has demonstrated the existence of multiple theta rhythms and cur-
rent generators in the hippocampus and EC (Buzsa´ki, 2002). While septal activity is required for
theta rhythmicity, and lesions targeting the medial septum eliminate theta oscillation in both struc-
tures, intrinsic hippocampal activity from CA3 and extrinsic EC inputs do also contribute to the
recorded theta oscillations (Buzsa´ki, 2002). Surgical removal of the EC unveils a theta oscillation
that depends on the integrity of CA3 and is highly coherent across hippocampal
layers
(Bragin et al., 1995). In the presence of an intact EC, however, the coherence between theta signals
in the stratum radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare is reduced (Kocsis et al., 1999), consistent with
an input competition between CA3 and EC3. Now, using optogenetic tools targeted to CA3 PV+
interneurons (Figure 2), we provide new results that conclusively support the coexistence of inde-
pendent theta oscillations in the hippocampus, by showing the specific modulation of the CA3-asso-
ciated Sch-IC vs. the EC-associated theta generators (lm-IC and PP-IC). Furthermore, variations in
theta power and frequency in each generator occurred dynamically and independently (Figure 4).
Nevertheless, phase shifts between the identified theta frameworks served to coordinate them in
pairs or triads, in a sub-second time-scale (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In turn,
we speculate, these hippocampal theta coupling states would be associated with distinct brain-wide
network states. In support of this view, we found selective behavioral/cognitive functions associated
with different states of between-framework theta synchronization (Figures 6 and 7). Finally, the
dynamic change in theta frequency observed in individual pathway-specific LFPs (Figure 4 and Fig-
ure 6—figure supplement 2) also argues against the view of the identified theta frameworks as
monolithic oscillations driven by external pacemakers, and rather suggests the cooperation of
weakly-coupled local oscillators and global rhythm generators for the fine-tuning of theta oscilla-
tions. Thus, theta activity in the hippocampus is neither unique, nor monolithic.

Overall, taking brain oscillations as rhythmic changes in neuronal excitability that can define
sequential information packages (Canolty and Knight, 2010; Fries, 2005), the dynamic variation in
theta synchrony found in the hippocampus likely reflects multiple theta-coordinated time-frames,
with phase differences between oscillations having a large impact on the timing of neuronal firing in
the respective layers. Synchronization of theta frameworks would, in turn, coordinate, though not
necessarily synchronize (Mizuseki and Buzsaki, 2014), firing sequences in consecutive hippocampal
stations. The processing streams thus generated could transmit independent information, e.g. driven
by memory retrieval or external environmental cues, or the result of integrating/comparing both
information sources, depending on the cognitive needs.

Theta-gamma interactions
Interactions between the phase of the theta oscillation and the amplitude of the gamma activity
have been extensively documented and proposed as an effective mechanism to integrate activity
across different spatial and temporal scales (Bragin et al., 1995; Bruns and Eckhorn, 2004;
Buzsa´ki and Draguhn, 2004; Canolty et al., 2006; Canolty and Knight, 2010; Colgin, 2015;
Colgin et al., 2009; Engel et al., 2001; Fell and Axmacher, 2011; Lakatos et al., 2008;
Lakatos et al., 2005; Lisman and Idiart, 1995; Lisman and Jensen, 2013; Mormann et al., 2005;
Palva et al., 2005; Saleh et al., 2010; Soltesz and Descheˆnes, 1993; Tort et al., 2009; Tort et al.,
2008; Zheng et al., 2016). Our analysis demonstrates that phase-amplitude CFC between theta and
gamma oscillations in the hippocampus is selective for theta-frameworks (Figure 3). Interactions
between theta and gamma were higher when IC-LFP theta oscillations were used as the temporal
reference for the corresponding layer-specific gamma activities, instead of a single LFP recording, as
commonly done. This observation, together with previous and important evidence demonstrating
that firing of principal cells in CA3 and EC3 is phase-locked to downstream theta-nested gamma
oscillations recorded in the CA1 stratum radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare,
respectively
(Colgin et al., 2009; Laszto´ czi and Klausberger, 2014; Schomburg et al., 2014), suggests that
local layer-specific circuits interact with upstream afferent pathways to organize hippocampal cell
assemblies in multiple theta-gamma frameworks.

The significant positive correlation between CFC strength and theta synchronization found in our
study (Figure 4) further suggests that layer-specific CFC might reflect the mechanism for theta

framework coordination. Co-modulation of gamma amplitude and theta phase can be the result of a
theta-driven process increasing gamma activity, a gamma-driven modulation of theta phase, or due
to the presence of a common external drive for both components, fast and slow, simultaneously.
The CFD index has been previously shown to reveal both fast-to-slow and slow-to-fast frequency
interactions in modelled data and real electrophysiological recordings (Helfrich et al., 2019;
Helfrich et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2017). We applied it here, for the first time
to hippocampal IC-LFPs, and unveiled, in contrast to a generalized assumption in the field, a pre-
dominant gamma-to-theta interaction (Figure 5). This directionality was confirmed directly on the
LFP signals (Figure 5), although the contribution of a third input controlling simultaneously both
rhythms cannot be fully discarded. We do not take this result as an indication of theta oscillations in
the hippocampus being generated by gamma activity. On the contrary, we suggest that gamma
activities,
(Cardin et al., 2009;
Neymotin et al., 2011; Orba´n et al., 2006; Rotstein et al., 2005; Stark et al., 2013; Tort et al.,
2007), impose phase shifts on the on-going theta oscillations in their corresponding layers. There-
fore, local gamma-generating circuits, driven by afferents from their respective upstream layers,
might not be activated at a particular theta phase, but rather be coordinating principal cells activity
and setting the phase of the local theta oscillation.

inhibitory-excitatory networks

reflecting the interplay of

While dissecting the precise circuit mechanisms supporting the above gamma-to-theta interaction
is out of the scope of the present work, several possibilities exist. Computational works have demon-
strated that theta-gamma CFC emerges from the interactions between functionally distinct interneu-
ron populations interconnected in a network of principal cells receiving an external theta rhythm
generator, such as the septal input (Neymotin et al., 2011; Orba´n et al., 2006; Rotstein et al.,
2005; Tort et al., 2007). Subsets of interneurons can phase-lock to different hippocampal rhythms
(Klausberger et al., 2003; Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008) and, interestingly, recent findings
have shown in the CA1 region that some interneurons can specifically phase-lock to slow-gamma
and others to medium-gamma, supporting the idea that different classes of interneurons drive slow
and medium gamma oscillations (Colgin, 2015; Ferna´ndez-Ruiz et al., 2017; Laszto´ czi and Klaus-
berger, 2014). Thus, an appealing mechanism for the gamma-modulation of theta phase would be
the control of different interneuron classes by pathway-specific inputs, which would entrain specific
gamma networks modulating principal cell excitability and firing in response to on-going theta
inputs, advancing or delaying theta phases. In support of this hypothesis, recent analyses of theta-
gamma associations on a theta cycle-by-cycle basis have demonstrated a significantly higher spike-
field phase synchrony for interneurons than pyramidal cells in the theta band (Zhang et al., 2019).
Finally, spiking resonance in principal cells may contribute to this mechanism too, since optogenetic
activation of basket interneurons (PV-cells) in the hippocampus and neocortex pace pyramidal cell
firing in the theta range, by virtue of postinhibitory rebound of Ih activity (Stark et al., 2013). In that
experiment, theta-band firing of excitatory neurons required rhythmic activation of inhibitory basket
cells, as white noise activation effectively modulated their activity but did not entrained pyramidal
theta-band firing (Stark et al., 2013). Feed-forward activation of interneurons from upstream layers
or an external rhythmic input (i.e. cholinergic or GABAergic inputs form the septum) are thus
required for resonance amplification. Intrinsic cellular properties and network mechanisms may thus
interact to support gamma-dependent coordination of theta phases across hippocampal layers.

The above interpretation would also explain phase-phase coupling between CA1 theta and CA1
slow- and medium-gamma (Belluscio et al., 2012), as the consequence of theta phase driven by
pathway-specific gamma activity entrained by upstream inputs in CA3 and EC3, respectively. Recent
studies, however, highlighted the importance of frequency harmonics and waveform asymmetry
when measuring phase-phase coupling (Scheffer-Teixeira and Tort, 2016) and also amplitude-
phase CFC (Cole and Voytek, 2017). Waveform asymmetry in oscillatory activity introduces spectral
content that cannot be defined solely by sinusoidal components (Amzica and Steriade, 1998) and,
therefore, may result in spurious CFC and CFD (Juhan et al., 2015; Cole and Voytek, 2017;
Kramer et al., 2008; Lozano-Soldevilla et al., 2016; Scheffer-Teixeira and Tort, 2016). Several
approaches have been developed to overcome these limitations (Cole and Voytek, 2019;
Kramer et al., 2008), improving the estimation of the theta phase and minimizing the effect of sharp
edges. We applied these methods in our analysis (Materials and methods). The specific waveform of
an oscillation should not be seen as a problem but as a source of physiological information when
appropriately considered (Cole and Voytek, 2017).

Parallel processing, segregation and integration
The proposed scenario provides a mechanism to coordinate distributed computations organized in
theta waves by synchronizing theta oscillations through theta-gamma CFC. We reasoned that layer-
specific interactions would phase-lock theta oscillations between layers when the integration of CA3-
and EC-associated information streams is required (Buzsa´ki and Moser, 2013; Dudai and Morris,
2013). We selected two well-known behavioral tasks to test this hypothesis. We first used a mis-
match novelty task (Lever et al., 2006) in which the memory representation of the context, involving
the CA3-associated pathway, is compared against the novel (mismatch) sensory input, conveyed by
the EC-associated pathways (to CA1 and DG). Our hypothesis predicted that, during the novelty
condition, a concomitant increase in CFC and theta synchronization in the three theta-gamma frame-
works should occur, something that we found experimentally (Figure 6). This result could not be
explained solely by the animal’s speed, which was indistinguishable in our experiments between
known and novelty conditions, nor by rearing behavior, sometimes associated with novelty explora-
tion (Barth et al., 2018). A link between CFC and theta synchrony was also found in the central arm
of the 8-shaped T-maze after correcting for running speed (Figure 7), in the location where the inter-
action between context representations from memory and from external sensory cues take place for
decision making and encoding (DeCoteau et al., 2007; Montgomery and Buzsa´ki, 2007;
Tort et al., 2008; Wood et al., 2000). These results bring together previous independent findings
layers
showing phase shifts between theta oscillations recorded in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal
(Montgomery et al., 2009) and increased CFC in the CA1 radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare IC-
LFPs (Schomburg et al., 2014) associated to the central arm.

A recent study using an uncharted novelty test showed increased theta-gamma CFC exclusively in
EC pathways, but not in the CA3 pathway (Barth et al., 2018). Importantly, in contrast to mismatch
novelty, uncharted novelty involves the exposure to a previously unvisited context and therefore it
lacks a memory representation. Thus, in the absence of a memory representation, only EC-pathways
conveying information about the environmental cues demonstrate enhanced theta-gamma coupling,
lending support to our hypothesis. Finally, we found that theta frequency decreased in the mismatch
novelty condition in the Sch-IC and PP-IC (Figure 6—figure supplement 2; Wells et al., 2013), while
it was reported to increase in the EC-pathways in uncharted novelty (Barth et al., 2018), suggesting
that theta frequency modulation was required to couple the three theta frameworks during mis-
match novelty.
Important

recent studies have investigated theta oscillations in a cycle-by-cycle manner
(Dvorak et al., 2018; Lopes-Dos-Santos et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019), demonstrating highly
dynamic changes in spectral components and theta-gamma interactions associated to different
behaviors. These studies support the notion that individual theta cycles represent flexible temporal
units to transiently organize CA1 computations. We found that layer-specific theta oscillations coex-
isting in the hippocampus couple and decouple dynamically, and we propose that it reflects a mech-
anism to integrate or segregate computations, respectively. This possibility is fundamentally
different from previous ones based on the segregation of computations in the phase of the theta
wave (Colgin et al., 2009; Lisman and Idiart, 1995; Lisman and Jensen, 2013), or in single theta
cycles as indicated above (Dvorak et al., 2018; Lopes-Dos-Santos et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019),
in that those were based on the rapid alternation of computational modes between phases or cycles,
respectively, but always of a unique theta framework. In contrast, our new proposal contemplates
parallel processing in cell assemblies receiving information from different theta frameworks. A
decrease in the coherence between the theta oscillations would decouple the processing streams,
segregating the underlying cognitive processes (i.e. retrieval from encoding). An increase in the
coherence would rather couple them, facilitating the integration in CA1 neurons and downstream
regions of both information streams (i.e. when stored and ongoing contextual information need to
be compared). Interestingly, however, the two models complement each other, since computations
in each theta framework would likely vary in a cycle-by-cycle manner, representing an even more ver-
satile coding framework.

Concluding remarks
Interactions between slow and fast brain oscillations have been measured in multiple brain regions

Engel et al., 2001; Lisman and Jensen, 2013). Despite its ubiquitous presence in fundamental cog-
nitive processes, its function is largely unknown. Our results provide a mechanism for parallel proc-
essing in the hippocampus based on the coexistence of multiple theta frameworks that support
both, segregated or integrated computations, depending on their synchronization level. Important
questions remain to be answered. How theta synchronization in the hippocampus relates to hippo-
campal-neocortical interactions (Siapas et al., 2005; Sirota et al., 2008) known to be favoured at
theta and beta frequencies (Igarashi et al., 2014; Moreno et al., 2016) and modulated by synaptic
plasticity in the hippocampus (A´ lvarez-Salvado et al., 2014; Canals et al., 2009)? The conditions
triggering the coordination between theta-gamma frameworks are not well understood, but given
that theta-gamma uncoupling seems to represent an early electrophysiological signature of hippo-
campal network dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (Goutagny et al., 2013; Iaccarino et al., 2016;
Palop and Mucke, 2009; Verret et al., 2012) as well as for schizophrenia and other psychiatric dis-
orders (Olypher et al., 2006; Phillips and Silverstein, 2003; Uhlhaas and Singer, 2006), further
and detailed mechanistic investigations are granted.

Materials and methods
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Instituto de
Neurociencias de Alicante, Alicante, Spain, and comply with the Spanish (law 32/2007) and European
regulations (EU directive 86/609, EU decree 2001–486, and EU recommendation 2007/526/EC).

Animals and surgery
Five male Long-Evans rats, with a weight of 250–300 g. were trained in different behavioral tasks,
with a multichannel electrode recording the electrophysiological activity in the hippocampus (data
are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/12537). The sample size was selected based
on previous reports with analysis of hippocampal
theta and/or gamma in a T-Maze task
(Montgomery and Buzsa´ki, 2007; Schomburg et al., 2014; Tort et al., 2008). All of them were
implanted with a 32 channels silicon probe (Neuronexus Technologies, Michigan, USA) connected in
turn to a jumper consisting of two corresponding connectors joined by 5 cm of flexible cable. An
Ag/AgCl wire (World Precision Instruments, Florida, USA) electrode was placed in contact with the
skin on the sides of the surgery area, and used as ground. The data were acquired at 5 kHz, with an
analog high-pass filter at 0.5 Hz. After digitalization, we initially low-pass filtered them at 300 Hz,
removed the net noise with Notch filters at 50 Hz and 100 Hz and down-sampled the signals at 2.5
kHz. We adjusted the final position of both electrodes using as a reference the typical evoked poten-
tials at the dentate gyrus (Andersen et al., 1966), so that a maximal population spike in the dentate
gyrus was recorded.

After the surgery, the rats were left for at least 10 days until they recovered completely. During
the first 72 hr, they were injected subcutaneously with analgesic twice per day (Buprenorphine, dose
2–5 mg/kg, RB Pharmaceutical Ltd., Berkshire, UK). During 1 week, they had as well antibiotic dis-
solved in the water (Enrofloxacin, dose 10 mg/kg, Syva, Leo´ n, Spain). The behavioral tasks were not
started until the animals showed no signs of discomfort with the manipulation of the implants.

Data acquisition
All subjects were trained before the surgery following the next protocol. The first three days con-
sisted on a habituation process with two 10 min sessions per day in an open field, with freedom of
movement. The environment was a methacrylate sandbox of 50 (cid:2) 50 cm, opened at the top and
with three visual cues in three of the walls. After that, they carried out two new sessions per day for
8 days, first repeating the habituation and then performing a modified T-maze task, that has been
described previously (Wood et al., 2000). It consisted in several tracks in 8-like shape (132/102/80
cm long/wide/high with track wide 8 cm, Figure 6e). The starting point was located at the beginning
of the central rail (Figure 6e, start) and the rat was forced to run across that arm (Figure 6e, center),
blocking other pathways with black panels. At the end of the track, it must choose one of the two
directions of the T-junction and a small drop of water was delivered at the corner (Figure 6e,
reward) in successfully trials. Each repetition is considered successful if the rat chooses the opposite
direction with respect to the previous trial, finding always a reward at the corner after the T-junction.
Then, another panel located after the water prevented the rat from retracing its route, forcing it to

go to the starting point across the corresponding side arm (Figure 6e, side), for a new trial. Each
session had a duration of 20 min with around 30 trials, and all the subjects reached a performance
greater than 80% in the last session. Only correct trials were considered for further analysis.

After the surgery and recovery, we repeated the same protocol for 8 days. For further electro-
physiological analysis, we considered only those sessions were the subjects kept a high level of per-
formance (80%) without any interference. There were in total between 2 and 5 sessions of 4
subjects. During the 9th day, we carried out a ‘novelty’ test. The rats were exposed to a novelty by
introducing them in a ‘novelty chamber’ located inside the familiar open field; such chamber was a
transparent methacrylate box with a square base 35 cm wide, and 40 cm high, opened at the top,
with sand paper on the floor to provide a noticeable tactile stimulus. After this time, the novelty
chamber was removed, and the animals were left another 10 min in the open field, considering this
session as the control condition for the analysis.

Except for the results in Figure 6, all the analyses were carried out during the control session (last

session), with freedom of movement in a well-known environment.

Optogenetic experiments
Four male Long-Evans transgenic rats, expressing Cre recombinase under the rat parvalbumin pro-
moter (LE-TG[Pvalb-iCre]2Ottc, NIDA, USA), were bred in our facilities, housed in pairs with food
and water available ad libitum and maintained on a 12/12 hr light-dark cycle.

Virus injection and surgeries
For the surgery, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (4.5% induction, 1–2% maintenance, in 0.8 l/
min O2) and locally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of bupivacaine (0.2 ml). All rats weighted
300–330 gr at the time of the first surgery. The Cre-dependent viral vector AAV1-EF1a-DIO-hChR2
(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE-hGH (Penn Vector Core) was bilaterally injected in dorsal CA3 (AP (cid:0)3.5 mm,
LM ± 3.6 mm from bregma and DV –2.8 mm from the brain surface) using a Hamilton syringe
attached to an infusion pump (1 ml per hemisphere at 1 ml/min). Thus, ChR2 is specifically expressed
in PV+ cells (PV-ChR2).

Two weeks after the virus injection, rats underwent a second surgery for two fiber-optic cannulas
and one recording electrode implantation. First, five screws were attached to the skull to strengthen
the fixation of the implant. As in the previous group of rats, a 32 channels silicon probe connected
to a jumper (Neuronexus Technologies, Michigan, USA) was placed in the left hippocampus covering
dorsal CA1 and DG. Reference wires were attached to one of the screws. The coordinates for the
electrode implantation were AP (cid:0)3.5 mm, LM ± 2.5 mm from bregma and DV –3.0 mm from the
brain surface, although its final position was adjusted based on the electrophysiological potentials
evoked by stimulating the perforant pathway. Then, a fiber-optic cannula (200 mm diameter, 0.66
NA, 10 mm length; Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada) was placed in the dorsal CA3 of both hemi-
spheres with an angle of 20˚ in the coronal plane at the coordinates AP (cid:0)3.5 mm, LM ± 5.2 mm from
bregma and DV –3.2 mm from the brain surface (Figure 2a). Once the electrode and the two fibers
were positioned, the stimulation electrode was removed and several layers of dental cement (Super-
Bond or Palacos) were applied to ensure enough fixation of all the components. The post-operative
care was the same as in the previous group of rats (see above). One of the subjects was excluded
from the experiment after the surgery and prior to any analysis due to the reduced quality of its
electrophysiological recordings.

Optogenetic manipulation in behaving animals and data acquisition
All behavioral procedures were conducted during the dark cycle. After the complete recovery follow-
ing the implantation surgery and before starting the experiments, we handled the animals during 5
days in order to habituate them to the experimenter as well as to the manipulation of the implant
(connection of the headstage and the fiber-optic patch cords).

Rats performed an 8 min daily session during 5 consecutive days in an already known open field
(50 (cid:2) 50(cid:2)40 cm box of black methacrylate) with bedding covering the floor. Animals were allowed
to freely explore the arena in each session while receiving ON/OFF periods of light stimulation. The
light for excitation of ChR2 was delivered at 50 mW/mm2 by a blue LED source (Prizmatix, Canada)

at a wavelength of 460 nm. Stimulation protocol consisted on 5 s 40 Hz trains with 1 ms light pulses
each 30 s during the entire session.

For the bilateral stimulation, we used a branching fiber-optic patch cord (500 mm diameter, 0.63
NA; Doric Lenses) connected to a rotatory joint (Prizmatix) which in turn connects to the LED source
by a fiber-optic patch cord (1 mm diameter, 0.63 NA; Doric Lenses). The power density of the deliv-
ered light was measured prior to each session using a powermeter (Thorlabs) to ensure the same
power density in all sessions (50 mW/mm2).

Light pulses were triggered by a stimulus generator (STG2004, Multichannel Systems, Reutlingen,
Germany) controlled by MC_Stimulus software (Multichannel Systems). Electrophysiological data
were recorded at 5 kHz sampling rate with an open-source acquisition system (Open Ephys) and syn-
chronized with light stimulation and video recording by using an I/O board (Open Ephys).

Inmunohystochemical analysis
After the performance of the experiments, the rats were perfused intracardially with PFA 4%. Brains
were kept in post-fixation for 3 hr at RT and then stored in PBS at 4˚C o/n. Then, brains were cut in
50mm-slices to corroborate the viral infection as well as the correct position of the recording elec-
trode and the fiber-optic cannulas. Slices were incubated with monoclonal PV antibody developed in
mouse (1:2000, Swant, Switzerland) and afterwards with an anti-mouse secondary antibody devel-
oped in goat (1:500, Alexa Fluor 594 dye, Life Technologies, USA). After completion of histological
treatments, brain sections were imaged using a fluorescence microscope (DM4000B, Leica) coupled
to a Neurolucida software (MicroBrightField, Inc) and images were processed with Image J software.

Video recording and tracking
The animals were monitored during all the tasks, and their behavior was recorded using a standard
camera located at the top of the room. Using those videos, the location of the subjects was tracked
with the software tracker (physlets; https://www.physlets.org/tracker/), taking their centroid as the
refence point. The synchronization of the video and the electrophysiological recordings was made
triggering a red LED and matching the temporal mark that it left in the recordings with the first
frame with light.

Current source density analysis of LFPs
The first approach to achieve the information of the sources contributing to the LFPs was the use of
CSD analysis (Freeman and Nicholson, 1975; Herreras, 1990; Holsheimer, 1987; Mitzdorf, 1985).
It measures the transmembrane currents, providing a spatiotemporal distribution of the local sinks
and sources (inward and outward currents, respectively). Contrary to the LFPs, these currents repre-
sent spatially localized phenomena, increasing the spatial resolution.

The membrane currents can be achieved following the Laplace equation and using the measured
field potentials and the conductivity of the medium. As the hippocampus is a layered structure, the
one-dimensional approach in the direction parallel to the recording electrode was used:

CSDm tð Þ ¼ (cid:0)

s
h2 um(cid:0)1 tð Þ (cid:0) 2um tð Þ þ umþ1 tð Þ

ð

Þ;

(1)

where um tð Þ is the LFP recorded at the m-th site, h is the distance between channels and s is the con-
ductivity of the extracellular space.

We assumed the whole structure as an isotropic and homogeneous medium. Though hippocam-
pal strata present different resistivities, they do not affect much to the temporal dynamics of specific
locations (Herreras, 1990; Holsheimer, 1987; Lo´ pez-Aguado et al., 2001). Therefore, the distance
and conductivity are constants, and they merely act as a scale factor. In this work, the distance
between contacts was h = 100 mm and we assumed a constant conductivity s = 350 W(cid:0)1cm(cid:0)1
(Lo´ pez-Aguado et al., 2001).

Though the CSD presents higher spatial resolution than the LFPs, it does not discriminate contri-
butions from different pathways. Multiple membrane currents with different origins may overlap spa-
tiotemporally, and local currents are also affected by the activity in nearby domains
(Herreras, 2016; Korovaichuk et al., 2010; Martı´n-Va´zquez et al., 2013). To overcome these limi-
tations, we applied an independent component analysis (ICA).

Independent Component Analysis of LFPs
Methods such as CSD analysis make it possible to isolate the local transmembrane currents by elimi-
nating propagated field potentials (see above). Nevertheless, different pathways are contributing to
these currents, and their activities may overlap spatiotemporally. To disentangle the specific sources
that generate the LFPs, we applied an ICA.

The effectiveness of this approach has been well studied and established in the hippocampus
(Ferna´ndez-Ruiz et al., 2012b; Herreras et al., 2015; Korovaichuk et al., 2010; Makarov et al.,
2010; Makarova et al., 2011; Schomburg et al., 2014). It aims to solve the problem of separating
N statistically independent sources that have been mixed in M output channels. To do that, it per-
forms a blind separation of patterns, because the different distributions of the sources are unknown.
Moreover, it assumes spatial immobility of the sources or, in other terms, a fixed location of the
axon terminals. The contribution of their synaptic currents to the LFP conforms the different inde-
pendent components (ICs) or generators to unravel.

Each recorded time-series um tð Þ is modeled as the sum of N neuronal sources multiplied by a con-

stant factor:

um tð Þ ¼

N

n¼1
X

Vmnsn tð Þ; m ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; M;

(2)

where Vmn is the mixing matrix with the voltage loadings of N LFP generators on M electrodes and
sn tð Þ is the time-series associated to the n-th LFP generator.

As the number of ICs with significant variance is usually low (4–7 out of 32) (Benito et al., 2014;
Korovaichuk et al., 2010), we applied a dimension reduction of the loading matrix by prior use of
principal component analysis, keeping 99% of the original LFP variance. For each structure and elec-
trographic state, the number of optimal components is determined by stepwise increase of the num-
ber of principal components until the new ICs are only noise (Makarov et al., 2010). Since noisy
components contribute negligible variance (in absence of artefacts in the signal) we always choose
this number plus two. There are several algorithms to compute the mixing matrix that transform LFP
data into ICs, nevertheless, all of them share a common theory framework. In this work, we have
used the information-maximization approach RUNICA (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995), implemented in
the matlab toolbox ‘ICAofLFPs’ (http://www.mat.ucm.es/~vmakarov/downloads.php). For compari-
son purposes, the kernel density ICA algorithm KDICA (Chen, 2006) was also computed, obtaining
similar results.

By definition, the ICA may extract as many generators as the number of LFP signals. To correctly
identify the presynaptic specificity of an IC, several conditions must be taken into account. First,
each IC contributes differently to the total variance (power) of the LFP. Only those with a significant
contribution (>1% in this work) were considered for further analysis. Second, the anatomic structure
of each generator is fixed in each subject (Castellanos and Makarov, 2006; Korovaichuk et al.,
2010; Makarov et al., 2010). In other words, the spatial profile of each ICs must be stable along the
time. This was assessed by applying the ICA in different short-term epochs (Korovaichuk et al.,
2010). Only those components present in all conditions with a stable spatial loading may represent
true current generators. Moreover, a certain degree of similarity is expected between subjects and a
specific pathway should have a comparable profile for different animals. Third, the synaptic specific-
ity of each generator was determined by stimulating their respective excitatory pathways with sub-
threshold evoked activity (Makarova et al., 2011). Fourth, not every synaptic input leaves a
footprint in the LFP. The geometry of the region and the distribution of axons and dendrites deter-
mine the real contribution of each pathway to the field potential (Buzsa´ki et al., 2012; Herre-
ras, 2016; Herreras et al., 2015). This requires specific realistic models to test the multiple origins
of the measured currents.

Applying ICA in our data recordings and considering all the conditions mentioned above, we
were able to extract three common and stable generators in all subjects (Figure 1 and Figure 1—
figure supplement 1). They correspond to pathway-specific inputs to the hippocampus. Two of
them were in CA1: one in str. radiatum, which corresponded to the synaptic terminals of Schaffer
collaterals from CA3 to the pyramidal cells in CA1 (Benito et al., 2014; Ferna´ndez-Ruiz et al.,
2012a; Korovaichuk et al., 2010; Makarova et al., 2011; Martı´n-Va´zquez et al., 2016;
Schomburg et al., 2014) (Sch-IC); the other component had a current sink in str. lacunosum-

moleculare (lm-IC), where are located the inputs from EC3 to the pyramidal cells in CA1
(Benito et al., 2014; Martı´n-Va´zquez et al., 2016; Schomburg et al., 2014). A third component
was identified in the DG, which corresponded to the axons projected from the EC layer II (EC2) to
the dendrites of
the granular cells through the perforant-pathway (Benito et al., 2014;
Korovaichuk et al., 2010; Makarova et al., 2011) (PP-IC). Note that the active synaptic domain of
PP-IC was in the molecular layer of the DG, but its field potential was dominant in the hilar region
(Figure 1). This was generated by the volume conduction of the cell membranes into the molecular
layer. The field potentials of common currents, above and below the hilus, are overlapped in this
region, thus increasing their electric field (Benito et al., 2014; Herreras, 2016; Herreras et al.,
2015).

The extracted ICs represent the current sources of specific pathways to the hippocampus. There-
fore, the temporal dynamics and rhythms of each generator reflects the activity generated in differ-
ent nearby regions (CA3, EC3 and EC2 for Sch-IC, lm-IC and PP-IC, respectively). One limitation of
this approach is that it cannot separate distinct temporal patterns within the same origin (i.e. theta
and gamma oscillations). This is the consequence of two main effects. First, the same neuron could
fire in multiple modes (Vinogradova, 2001). Moreover, the currents generated by synaptic terminals
from the same region are fully overlapped in the space and their combination made up a single gen-
erator. It should be noted at this point that ICA requires independence in space and time. Therefore,
two spatially separated sources with exactly the same temporal dynamics would converge in a single
component. Nevertheless, small differences in the signals’ co-variation (i.e. temporal jitter and/or
imperfect amplitude co-variation) would allow a correct separation of the two sources, even if there
is a high coherence between them (Makarova et al., 2011).

Another consideration is that the strongest generators could introduce contamination in other
components (Korovaichuk et al., 2010; Schomburg et al., 2014). To ensure that the huge theta
power is not affecting the discrimination of ICs, we separated the LFP in slow and fast rhythms by fil-
tering the raw LFPs at 30 Hz (low-pass at <30 Hz and a high-pass at >30 Hz, respectively). The ICA
was applied to each filtered data-set separately. We compared the resultant ICs with those using
the unfiltered data, confirming that the same generators were found in all conditions with quite simi-
lar time-series (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).

ICA does not ensure the correct polarity and amplitude of each generator. However, as the ICA
algorithm is invertible, the LFPs generated by each component can be retrieved separately. The
CSD can be applied to these reconstructed signals, obtaining the sinks and sources of each specific
pathway. Such partial signals do have the correct polarity and amplitude (Korovaichuk et al., 2010;
Martı´n-Va´zquez et al., 2013).

Preprocessing and power analysis of time series
After computing the ICA algorithm, the dataset corresponding to each subject was composed by
three time-series. These signals were downsampled at 625 Hz to improve the speed of computa-
tional analysis. They were also normalized, imposing to each dataset an averaged mean value of
zero and a standard deviation of one to each signal separately. This way, we increase the similarities
inter-subject and facilitate their comparison.

Power spectra were estimated using the multitaper method (Thomson, 1982). For power analysis
at specific frequency bands we used an approach based on filtering and Hilbert transform
(Jackson et al., 2006; O´ lafsdo´ ttir et al., 2017). First, the signal is bandpass filtered with a FIR filter
between the frequencies of interest. Then, we computed the Hilbert transform and the instanta-
neous power was estimated as the squared complex modulus of the signal at each time point. The
mean value was obtained as the averaged power in a certain time window. We defined the following
frequency bands which are used along the text (unless otherwise indicated): delta (1–4 Hz), theta (6–
10 Hz), slow gamma (30–60 Hz), medium gamma (60–100 Hz) and fast gamma (100–150 Hz).

The linear interaction between IC-LFPs at each specific frequency was assessed using a coherence
analysis. It measures the ratio between the cross power spectral density and their individual power
spectral densities and was computed using the mscohere.m function in Matlab. The statistical signifi-
cance was determined by a surrogate analysis (1000 surrogates in this work). With this methodology,
the temporal relationship between signals was broken by randomly displacing one signal respect to
the other. Then, the coherence surrogated results at each frequency were approximated to a

Gaussian distribution and the significance threshold was the value for which the previous cumulative
distribution was 0.95 (p=0.05).

To evaluate the distribution of the gamma activity along the phase of theta, the signals were first
filtered at the frequencies of interest (gamma and theta) and the amplitude and phase were
extracted using the Hilbert transform. Then, for each theta cycle, the envelope of the gamma activity
was divided into N equidistant bins; an average along all cycles was then taken. Similar to the coher-
ence analysis, the statistical significance was assessed by a surrogate analysis (1000 surrogates), ran-
domly shifting the gamma signal with respect to the theta phase. The surrogate distribution was
estimated by averaging the results of all simulations.

Detection of theta rhythm
From the whole recordings, only those epochs with a real theta rhythm in all components where con-
sidered for further analysis, that is, with high power at that band. Moreover, as oscillations with low
amplitude could result in a less accurate estimation of their phase, we selected only those cycles
with a minimum value of theta power to avoid this issue. To find such threshold we have modeled
theta rhythm data as the combination of theta oscillations (X(cid:18) tð Þ) and pink noise (Xn tð Þ) to simulate
the neural noise of the recordings:

(cid:18) tð Þ ¼ Xn tð Þ þ X(cid:18) tð Þ
Xn

(3)

The noise was computed using the function pinknoise from Matlab, while X(cid:18) tð Þ was composed by

tið Þ, we could estimate perfectly the phase of the theta rhythm, that is this was
the ground truth. Briefly, for each simulation we changed the relative power between both compo-
nents by varying the A parameter and we estimated the phase of the theta oscillation (see below).
Doing so, we were able to measure the error between our estimation and the ground truth as a func-
tion of the relative theta power and then find the value that minimizes that error. A detailed descrip-
tion of these steps follows.

½

For each dataset, we bandpass filtered each signal at delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (6-10 Hz) frequen-
cies. Then, we computed the Hilbert transform and the instantaneous power was estimated as the
squared complex modulus of the signal at each time point. The relative theta power was obtained
(O´ lafsdo´ ttir et al., 2017;
as the ratio between the averaged theta by the delta power
Jackson et al., 2006). The phase of the oscillation was estimated for the theta filtered signal through
Hilbert, being zero and p radians the values corresponding to the trough and the peak of the cycle,
respectively. Finally, the error was measured as the averaged distance (in milliseconds) between
each trough of the real phase and the estimated one. Additionally, we computed the minimum error
as that obtained when Xn tð Þ is set to zero. This value corresponds to the noise introduced by the
method used to estimate the phase and does not depend on the power. The relationship between
the ratio and the error is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.

Using the simulated data, we considered that the theta power was not influencing the estimation
of the theta phase when the error due to the amplitude (i.e. not considering the one introduced by
the filtering) was lower than 1 ms. This corresponded to a ratio of theta power 3.78 times (we took
four for simplicity) higher than delta (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). In the real recordings we
expect not only neural noise but also activity at the delta band. Thus, the theoretical threshold
obtained by this procedure represent a conservative measurement. For those cases with high delta
activity, the threshold would be more restrictive as the ratio decreases, but the theta power would
be always high enough to guarantee a correct estimation of the phase.

To detect the theta rhythm in all the ICs recorded, we used a sliding window of one theta cycle
(approximately 125 ms) and selected only those epochs where the ratio between their theta power
by delta (computed as described above) was higher than 4. Moreover, analysis taken thresholds of 6
and 8 were also done for comparison purposes, showing no significant differences.

Optogenetic modulation of pathway-specific theta activity
In the Cre-expressing transgenic subjects we analyzed whether the light stimulation of CA3 PV-inter-
neurons had an effect exclusively in the Schaffer collateral theta output. We compared time windows
of two seconds immediately after the stimulation with the first two seconds of the stimulus. This
period was chosen to minimize the influence of different locomotor activities between windows. For
all trials, only those with theta oscillation (see above) were further considered. Then, we computed
the power spectrum of each IC-LFP using a multitaper approach (Thomson, 1982).

Inter-cycle phase clustering
To estimate the relative theta phase between ICs, we used a modified inter-trial phase clustering
approach (Cohen, 2014) to account for differences between cycles instead of trials (ICPC). In this
methodology, each trial is defined as a vector with modulus one and the angle corresponding to the
phase of the oscillation measured at a specific time point (jt). Then, the ICPC is computed as the
modulus of the averaged vector among all trials:

If the distribution of angles is uniform along the polar axis, then the ICPC value is zero. On the
contrary, values near one indicate a preferred phase in the distribution, being one when all trials
have the same phase.

For the analysis in Figure 1h, the phases of each signal were extracted following Cole and Voy-
tek, 2019 to have a better characterization of the shape of the theta rhythm. The LFP measured in
the pyramidal layer of CA1 (pyr. CA1) was considered as reference, where its trough and peak coin-
cide with 0 and p radians, respectively. We calculated the ICPC for the different components sepa-
rately, where each trial was the phase of the IC measured at each trough of pyr. CA1. Thus, the
number of trials corresponded to the number of theta cycles in pyr. CA1 and the angle and value of
the ICPC can be interpreted as the phase difference and the stability of the IC with respect to pyr.
CA1, respectively.

The statistical significance was assessed by a surrogate analysis (1000 surrogates in this work),
randomly shifting the phase of the IC and keeping pyr. CA1 constant. For each simulated dataset,
the ICPC was computed fitting all the surrogated results into a normal distribution. Then, the p-value
associated to the ICPC of the IC was obtained as one minus the previous normal cumulative distribu-
tion evaluated at the ICPC value.

Cycle-by-cycle synchronization using ICPC
Using the ICPC approach, the degree of coherence between theta rhythms was estimated for each
cycle separately. Doing this process, a dynamic measurement of synchronization can be done identi-
fying time epochs of high and low coherence. Considering two ICs, one acting as the reference, the
ICPC value of each theta cycle was computed using only three cycles, which corresponded to the rel-
ative phase at that cycle and the previous and consecutive ones (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). If
the waves were highly coherent, then their phase would be similar along theta cycles, resulting in an
ICPC value close to 1; for those with different phases, the ICPC would be lower. In this work, we
considered the theta oscillation in lm-IC as the reference to compute the ICPC, as it had the highest
amplitude at that frequency. Moreover, the ICPC between pairs of signals (i.e. lm-IC vs. Sch-IC and
lm-IC vs. PP-IC) was averaged as an approximation of the global synchronization of the network at
each time epoch.

The instantaneous ICPC can be compared to other metrics as frequency or power, analyzing the
correlation between synchronized state and the features of the signals. To compute each correlation,
the data were classified into 10 groups as a function of the ICPC, with ten equidistant bins from 0.75
to 1. We chose these values as they contain at least the 90% of the cycles in all subjects and 80
cycles per bin (around 10 s). Then, the averaged value of the different metrics was computed for
each group, analyzing the correlation between the means and the ICPC value. To identify reliably
relationships, we compared if the resultant correlation value (r) was higher than the obtained by a
surrogate analysis. Each simulated dataset (100 surrogates in this work) was built by randomly

shifting the IC components, breaking any temporal relationship between them. Then, the correlation
between the ICPC and other features of interest were computed, fitting the results to a gaussian dis-
tribution. We considered that a correlation was significant if its value was higher than the 95th per-
centile of the surrogatedistribution.

Multiple linear regression
The joint analysis of several features as predictors of the ICPC was done using a multiple linear
regression. Firstly, we ranked all the values associated to each feature (function tiedrank.m in matlab)
to minimize the effect of outlayers in the dataset. Then, a single model is fitted using each predictor
multiplied by a beta factor:

ICPC ¼ b0 þ b1power þ b2frequency þ b3speed þ . . . þ "

(6)

Where b0 is a constant value and " are the residuals.
The contribution of one specific predictor to the total explained variance of the model is esti-
mated by fitting a reduced multiple linear regression without that predictor and computing the dif-
ference between variances in the full model minus the reduced one.

To estimate if each variable is significantly contributing to the ICPC across subjects, we followed
Montgomery and Buzsa´ki, 2007 and tested their associated beta values for a statistical difference
from zero (t-test, Bonferroni corrected).

Cross-Frequency coupling
Interactions between the phase of a low frequency oscillation and the amplitude of a faster one
were measured using an approach based on the modulation index (MI) (Canolty et al., 2006;
Tort et al., 2008). The original method computed the phases and amplitudes through filtering and
Hilbert transform. Nevertheless, theta rhythms in the hippocampus are non-sinusoidal oscillations
and filtering the signal results in errors at estimating the waveform shape and could introduce spuri-
ous coupling (Cole and Voytek, 2017; Kramer et al., 2008). A new methodology has been pro-
posed to overcome this issue and estimate the instantaneous phase of this kind of oscillations
(Cole and Voytek, 2019). Briefly, we used a combination of a narrowband filter to detect the zero-
crossing points (which correspond to the ascendant and descendant slope of the oscillation, or the
phases p/2 and 3p/3, respectively) and a broadband filter to find the trough and the peak (phases 0
and p, respectively). This way, the phase of the signal does not vary monotonically (as in the case of
a sinusoidal one) but could follow fast changes in the cycle as an abrupt ascendant slope and a soft
descent. We named this signal as x(cid:18)’ tð Þ.

The amplitude of the faster oscillation is computed as the envelope of the signal filtered at the
specific frequency which we want to analyze. First, we used a filter centered at that frequency and
with a bandwidth at least two times the frequency of the phase signal where the coupling is
expected to be maximum (Juhan et al., 2015). Considering that the main rhythm in the hippocam-
pus is around 8 Hz, the bandwidth should have at least 16 Hz (we used 20 Hz in this work). Then, the
envelope is computed using the Hilbert transform. The resultant signal is labelled as xgA tð Þ.

To compute the MI, we divide each cycle of x(cid:18)’ tð Þ into N bins. To avoid the issues introduced in
this method due to the previously mentioned non-uniform theta oscillation (van Driel et al., 2015;
Cole and Voytek, 2017), these bins were not of the same size, but were equalized along the phase
of the theta cycle. Instead of using N bins, we divided each cycle into 4 segments which correspond
to the epochs between the peak, the trough and both ascendant and descendant pendants
(Cole and Voytek, 2019), and then divided that segment into N/4 bins of the same size. Therefore,
N/4 bins were used from the trough to the middle of the ascendant phase, N/4 bins from this point
to the peak and so on. After that, we computed the mean amplitude of xgA tð Þ at each bin, calling
<xgA>’ jð Þ the amplitude at the phase bin j. From them, we can calculate the entropy H, defined by:

(9)

A value of MI near 0 indicates lack of phase-to-amplitude modulation, while larger MI values

reflect higher coupling between both signals.

The values obtained using the MI given by Equation 9 were compared to those provided by the
phase-amplitude coupling index proposed by Canolty and colleagues (mean vector
length;
Canolty et al., 2006). The latter is estimated as the degree of asymmetry of the probability density
function of the gamma amplitude across the phase of theta. Both methods yielded similar results.

The statistical significance has been assessed following the steps proposed by Canolty and col-
leagues (Canolty et al., 2006), by a surrogate analysis (n = 100 surrogates) in which each surrogate
is built by cutting the phase signal at a random point and exchanging the resultant segments. This
breaks the temporal relationship between both time-series minimizing the distortion of their dynam-
ics (Juhan et al., 2015). The MI estimated among surrogates represents the coupling due to the
oscillatory nature of the signals but not by a real temporal relationship. Therefore, the MI values of
all surrogates are approximated to a gaussian distribution, whose 95th percentile is considered as a
significance threshold.

Cross-Frequency directionality
The MI is a measurement of the degree of interaction between the phase and the amplitude of two
frequencies, but it has no information regarding the directionality in this coupling. On the one hand,
the theta phase would modulate the amplitude at gamma frequencies while, on the other hand, the
gamma activity could be leading the phase. To identify leader and follower in this interaction, we
have used the CFD index (Jiang et al., 2015). The main idea is that, supposing that the phase com-
ponent precedes the amplitude with a fixed time delay of k ms, the distance from the peak of the
phase to the next peak of the amplitude should be k ms (i.e. there is an increase of gamma activity k
ms after the peak of theta phase). Thus, as not all phase cycles have the same duration, the distance
from the peak of the gamma amplitude to the next peak of theta may vary. Nevertheless, in the
case of gamma activity preceding theta, the result would be the opposite. The peak of gamma activ-
ity should appear k ms before the peak of the phase, while the timing from phase to amplitude
would be different for each cycle. Note that the CFD is an estimation of the temporal relations
between signals, but not a measurement of causality per se as, for example, a third source could be
interacting with both signals.

The CFD identifies this relationship using the phase-slope index (PSI; Nolte et al., 2008), a mea-
surement of directionality between time series. Briefly, if the oscillation of one signal x(t) at a certain
frequency is driving a second one y(t) with a time delay, then the phase difference between them at
that specific delay will change consistently with the frequency of the signals. The slope of the phase
is obtained in function of the frequency, and its sign will indicate who is the driver. If the slope is
positive (higher the frequency, higher the phase difference between signals) then x(t) leads y(t) in
time, while negative values would indicate that y(t) precedes x(t). The CFD is a variant of the PSI,
where one signal is the theta component, and the other the envelope of the gamma activity.

Calling x tð Þ to the original signal, xv

This methodology has been proposed specifically for those frameworks with phase-amplitude
coupling as more classical approaches like Granger Causality (Granger, 1969) have some unavoid-
able limitations due to the use of filters (Barnett and Seth, 2011) and the differences of signal-to-
noise ratio in both components (Nolte et al., 2010), which provoke that they cannot identify the cor-
rect directionality in CFC models (Jiang et al., 2015).

To provide statistical significance, a new surrogate test (n = 100 surrogates) has been developed
following the same steps than in the MI analysis. Note that in this case, two thresholds are imposed,
considering both tails of the gaussian distribution (i.e. positive and negative values). In this work, we
have used the Matlab toolbox HERMES (Niso et al., 2013) and the implementation of PSI in Matlab
code (http://doc.ml.tu-berlin.de/causality/). All the Matlab code developed to compute cross-fre-
quency analysis is freely available at https://canalslab.com/. To emphasize the directionality in the
region of higher CFC, the MI comodulogram has been redefined as a mask, with values from 0 to 1
(minimum and maximum value MI). Applying this mask to the CFD comodulogram, areas without
phase-amplitude coupling are attenuated, while the main cluster remains constant.
