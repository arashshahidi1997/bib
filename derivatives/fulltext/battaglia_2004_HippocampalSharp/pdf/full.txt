Hippocampal sharp wave bursts coincide with
neocortical “up-state” transitions

The sleeping neocortex shows nested oscillatory activity in different frequency ranges, characterized by fluctuations
between “up-states” and “down-states.” High-density neuronal ensemble recordings in rats now reveal the interaction
between synchronized activity in the hippocampus and neocortex: Electroencephalographic sharp waves in the
hippocampus were more probable during down-states than during up-states, and tended to coincide with transitions
from down-states to up-states. The form of cortical activity fluctuations and their interactions with sharp waves
depend on sleep depth: In deeper sleep stages, characterized by strong neocortical oscillation in the delta range or
slower (∼0.8–4 Hz), sharp-wave-triggered peri-event time histograms (PETH) are consistent with a longer duration for
down-states than for up-states.
In lighter sleep, the sharp-wave-triggered PETH suggested longer up-states than
down-states. These results highlight the interplay in the hippocampal/neocortical loop: Decreased neocortical input
during down-states may be a factor in generation of sharp waves. In turn, sharp waves may facilitate down-to-up
transitions. This interplay may reflect joint memory trace reactivation in the hippocampus and in the neocortex,
possibly contributing to consolidation of long-term memory: Off-line reactivation of recent neural activity patterns in
the hippocampus occurs during 50–100-msec electroencephalographic sharp waves, corresponding to pyramidal-cell
population bursts. The neocortical up-states starting in correspondence with sharp waves may be influenced by the
reactivated information carried by the hippocampal sharp wave.

Brain activity during sleep or idle periods may be crucial for
memory processes (Plihal and Born 1999; Stickgold et al. 2000;
Sutherland and McNaughton 2000; Maquet 2001). Hypotheses
descending from David Marr’s theory of memory (Marr 1970)
assume that information acquired during a waking period is re-
activated in the hippocampus during sleep episodes, leading to a
reactivation and consequent consolidation (i.e., reorganization
and strengthening) of the neocortical memory trace (Pavlides
and Winson 1989; Wilson and McNaughton 1994; Skaggs and
McNaughton 1996; Kudrimoti et al. 1999; Louie and Wilson
2001; Hoffman and McNaughton 2002; Ribeiro et al. 2004). The
intracortical connections created as the outcome of this trace-
reactivation process would provide the link between memory
items stored in different cortical areas (Marr 1970) and support
long-term memory, in a hippocampus-independent manner.

During slow wave sleep, the neocortex engages in largely
synchronized activity patterns, with alternation of periods of
generalized elevated activity (“up-states”) and depressed activity
(“down-states”) (e.g., Steriade and Buzsaki 1990; Cowan and Wil-
son 1994; Timofeev et al. 2001; Petersen et al. 2003). This process
appears to be a network phenomenon that originates in the neo-
cortex. Up-states are supported by excitatory intracortical con-
nections (Steriade et al. 1993; Sanchez-Vives and McCormick
2000) balanced by an increased activity of inhibitory interneu-
rons (Timofeev et al. 2001). The positive feedback induced by
these recurrent connections makes the cortical network capable
of sustaining coherent activity fluctuations at several time scales,
from the slow (<1 Hz), regular oscillations observed in ketamine-

anesthetized animals (Steriade et al. 1993; Destexhe et al. 1999),
to the more irregular, slow (∼1 Hz) fluctuations seen in the un-
anesthetized animal (Timofeev et al. 2001; Petersen et al. 2003)
and also in human surface electroencephalogram (Achermann
and Borbely 1997), to the activity in the faster delta frequency
range (2–4 Hz, e.g., Ball et al. 1977). The slower end of this
frequency range is often referred to as “up/down-state fluctua-
tions.” Such activities in different frequency domains can actu-
ally coexist in a coordinate fashion: for example, delta oscilla-
tions are especially prominent during up-states, with each up-
state encompassing several delta cycles, and the amplitude of
delta declining from the beginning to the end of the up-states.
The concomitant hippocampal EEG pattern, termed large
irregular activity (LIA), is characterized by short (50–150 msec)
episodes of coherent burst firing, accompanied by dendritic
sharp wave (SPW) LFPs and high-frequency LFP oscillations in
the CA1 pyramidal layer (100–200 Hz, ripple oscillations) (O’Keefe
and Nadel 1978; Buzsaki et al. 1992; Csicsvari et al. 2000), amidst
relatively suppressed activity. SPWs occur at random intervals
with a mean frequency of ∼1 Hz during LIA, and appear to be
generated in CA3, the portion of the hippocampus richest in
recurrent connections (Ishizuka et al. 1990).

SPWs influence the firing of neurons in the entorhinal cor-
tex (the major cortical efferent of the hippocampus) (Chrobak and
Buzsaki 1994, 1996), and are weakly correlated with the occur-
rence of thalamocortical spindle oscillations (Siapas and Wilson
1998), which are also related to the occurrence of up-states (Ste-
riade 2000). Sirota et al. (2003) showed that cortical oscillations
in somatosensory cortex and hippocampal activity are related on
the short time scale: Ripple events are associated with cortical
discharges occurring 50–100 msec earlier. Moreover, they
showed that both spindle and delta oscillations affect hippocam-
pal activity, with hippocampal synaptic inputs phase-locked to
the cortical oscillations, possibly influencing the generation of
SPWs.

global cortical activity at slow time scales
and hippocampal sharp waves, which is the
subject of the present work.

Some of these results have been pre-
sented in an abstract format (Battaglia et al.
2001).

Results
To establish the relationship between SPWs
and neocortical activity, multiple single
unit activity was recorded from an array of
144 independently positionable electrodes
chronically implanted on three rats. The
electrode array spanned about two-thirds of
the dorsal surface of the neocortex, includ-
ing anterior cingulate, primary and second-
ary motor, somatosensory, dorsal parietal,
retrosplenial, and visual areas (Fig. 1A). At
the same time, the left CA1 pyramidal layer
EEG (Fig. 2) was recorded from one elec-
trode.

session. Average yield per session was approximately 50 neurons. (A) Outline of the cortical struc-
tures spanned by the electrode array, as implanted on rats 1 and 2. The array on rat 3 was placed

Hippocampal memory trace reactivation is strongest during
SPWs (Kudrimoti et al. 1999), indicating that trace reactivation
might, indeed, reflect the information stored in the CA3 synaptic
matrix (McNaughton 1983; Buzsaki 1989; Shen and McNaugh-
ton 1996). Hippocampal SPWs, therefore, are a possible mecha-
nism for the transfer of reactivated memories to the neocortex,
and for the organization of coordinated cortical retrieval and
consolidation (Hoffman and McNaughton 2002). These consid-
erations motivated the investigation of the relationship between

During recording sessions, rats 1 and 2
slept or rested for two periods (Rest 1 and
Rest 2) of 25–40 min. Between these peri-
ods, they performed a behavioral task. Rat 3
was only recorded during one rest period of
25–40 min in each session and did not per-
form a behavioral task. Only the rest period data were analyzed
for this report. Up to 96 cells were recorded simultaneously (Fig.
1B; total 2812 cells, in 61 sessions; 2298 from rat 1, 288 from rat
2, 226 from rat 3). Some of the cells may have been recorded from
more than once across sessions, given that not all electrodes were
moved every day (firing rate: mean: 1.94 (cid:1) 2.89 Hz; min: 0.005
Hz, max: 31.06 Hz).

Neocortical neuronal activity exhibited coherent fluctua-
tions spanning all of the recorded areas. Spectral analysis of the
total spike activity revealed discrete bouts
of oscillations in the spindle range and in
the delta/slow range during most of the re-
corded rest sessions (see, e.g., Fig. 3A).
These episodes of oscillations accounted for
35% of the total recording time.

During troughs of slow/delta oscilla-
tions, generalized neuronal silence was of-
ten observed for a duration of ∼200–400
msec (Figs. 2 and 3B,C). The same degree of
synchrony was observed across the sampled
recorded areas during spindle oscillations
(data not shown). Fluctuations on a longer
time scale were also present, and were re-
flected in the autocorrelogram of the global
population activity, which decayed with a
time constant of 2.4 (cid:1) 0.5 sec (Fig. 3D).
“Up-states” were defined arbitrarily as those
1-sec periods in which the number of “ac-
tive” cells (one or more spikes) exceeded
the 95% confidence threshold, computed
from the randomly and independently
shuffled interval series of all cells (see Mate-
rials and Methods). In all, 15.2% (cid:1) 4.3% of
the intervals in Rest 1 and 13.0% (cid:1) 3.0% in
Rest 2 exceeded this threshold, with activity
in at least 58.3% (cid:1) 5.0% and 57.5% (cid:1) 5.1%
of neurons, respectively. The recording ses-
sion with the smallest effect yielded 7.6%
of above-threshold intervals (p < 0.0001).

sampled cortical areas. During the troughs of these oscillations, neuronal activity was often com-
pletely suppressed.

Sharp waves and cortical “up-state” transitions

Figure 3 Global fluctuations of cortical activity and hippocampal sharp waves. (A) Power spectral density analysis of 700 sec of cortical activity. The
power spectrum of combined instantaneous firing rate for the 84 recorded cells was estimated using a sliding 5-sec window. Episodes of coordinated
oscillations in the spindle range (indicated by the s) and in the delta/slow range (indicated by the d) are visible. (B) Enlargement of the 100-sec period
between the white dashed lines in A, showing delta oscillations. (C) Average instantaneous cortical firing rate during the same interval. The interval
between the two red lines is the same as depicted in Figure 2. Note that the absolute values of the firing rates are different from Figure 2 because a larger
smoothing parameter was used. (D) Autocorrelogram of the total activity of the recorded neocortical population. In each recording session, the spikes
from all the recorded cells were pooled into a single binned time series that was used to compute the autocorrelation function. The normalization was
chosen such that the asymptotic value of the autocorrelation coincides with the population average firing rate per cell. The data shown are an
across-session average. The decline of the autocorrelogram was fit with an exponential function with a time constant of 2.4 (cid:1) 0.5 sec. Time bin, 200
msec. (E) Autocorrelogram of the time of occurrence of SPWs. There is a decay from t = 0 to the baseline, that can be approximated with an exponential
function with a time constant of 5.5 (cid:1) 0.06 sec. This indicates that SPWs do not occur as a Poisson process with a constant rate throughout the
recording sessions.

The sharp-wave-triggered Peri-event time histograms (PETH)
of the global cortical activity showed that SPW events were ac-
companied by a brief burst of neocortical firing (Fig. 4). PETHs
computed during periods of identified delta/slow oscillations
were different from those computed during periods in which no
delta/slow oscillations were present. During delta/slow oscilla-

tions (Fig. 4A,B), sharp wave events were preceded by a dip in
average cortical firing lasting for ∼500 msec. The average cortical
firing was at the baseline level immediately before the dip. After
the sharp wave event, the average cortical firing was increased,
and slowly decayed to baseline with a time constant of the order
of 3 sec. In epochs that did not include delta/slow oscillations,

an increase in SPW frequency at the transi-
tion, which started 1–2 sec ahead of the
transition.

To estimate the proportion of indi-
vidual cells exhibiting statistically signifi-
cant modulation around SPWs, the firing
rates before, during, and after each SPW
event were compared with an estimate of
the SPW-independent firing rates (Fig. 5;
Table 1), for both delta/slow epochs and
non-delta/slow epochs. For all intervals,
there was an elevated number of signifi-
cantly (two-tailed t-test, p < 0.05) up- or
down-modulated (or both) cells. The pro-
portion of up- and down-modulated cells
was in most cases different from chance; the
significance of such differences was tested
by a binomial sign test, whose results are
reported in Table 1. The delta/slow epochs
showed similar numbers of up- and down-
modulated cells before the sharp waves
(consistent lack of deviation from baseline
observed in the PETH prior to sharp waves),
and larger numbers of up-modulated cells at
the sharp wave times and in the subsequent
interval (consistent with the long-lasting
increase from baseline registered in the
PETH). At the time of the sharp waves, there
were significantly fewer down-modulated
cells than chance. In non-delta/slow ep-
ochs, there was an elevated number of
down-modulated cells in the pre-SPW inter-
vals, a prevalence of up-modulated cells at
sharp wave times, and similar numbers of
up- and down-modulated cells in the inter-
val following the sharp waves. The pattern
was similar in each of the experimental ani-
mals (Table 1). To assess whether these ef-
fects were localized in only some of the re-
corded cortical areas, the 12 (cid:3) 12 electrode
array was divided into nine square regions
(3 (cid:3) 3). The number of SPW-modulated
cells was above chance in all regions studied
both in delta/slow epochs and non-delta/
slow epochs, although there were regional
differences (p < 0.02, (cid:1)2 test). The effects
seemed to be strongest in the cortical re-
gions spanning the midline, but further
study would be required to rule out vari-
ables other than region in the generation of
this effect. The z-scores for sharp wave-
modulation of individual cells in the two
rest periods were only moderately corre-
lated (r = 0.48 in the interval corresponding
to SPWs, and lower in the other intervals), indicating that differ-
ent ensembles were activated during different SPW events.

The probability of SPW occurrence also fluctuated weakly
on time scales comparable to those of neocortical slow oscilla-
tions, as shown by the autocorrelogram of SPW times, which
decays with a time constant of 5.51 (cid:1) 0.06 sec (Fig. 3E).

Dicussion
The three main results of this study are the observation of deeply
synchronized fluctuations in neuronal firing in the delta/slow
frequency range across almost the entire neocortex, an observa-

Figure 4 SPW interaction with neocortical neural activity. (A) Peri-event time histogram (PETH)
of cortical population activity during the periods of identified global oscillations in the delta/slow
range, centered on hippocampal sharp wave events. A transient increase in firing rate was evident
at the time of the sharp waves. On the long time scale, the firing rate was larger after the sharp
wave event. Firing rate showed a short lasting dip right before (200–400 msec) the SPW, probably
related to the in-phase occurrence of delta oscillation, and was at baseline level shortly before that.
After the SPW events, average cortical firing rate showed a much longer decay, spanning several
seconds (error bars = SEM; bin size, 100 msec). (B) Same PETH, with an expanded scale, illustrating
both the fast dip before SPWs and the transient increase at the time of SPWs (bin size, 20 msec).
(C) Sharp-wave-triggered PETH (bin size, 100 msec) of cortical firing during periods in which
oscillations in the delta/slow range were absent. The transient increase at SPW time was still
present, albeit of smaller amplitude, but there was no fast dip preceding SPWs. A prolonged period
of increasingly negative modulation was observed for several seconds leading up to the sharp
waves. After SPWs, the return to baseline was relatively fast. (D) Same PETH shown on an enlarged
scale (bin size, 20 msec). Note that, because the shapes of the PETH functions represent averages
over many SPW events, they do not necessarily reflect the shape of individual events (see Fig. 6 for
further explanation). (E) PETH of SPW event occurrence, centered on the down-to-up-state tran-
sitions in the total cortical spike activity, showing increased SPW probability around such transi-
tions. Note that the baseline value was higher on the left-hand side of the PETH than on the
right-hand side, signaling that sharp waves were more frequent during the down-states than
during the up-states.

the sharp wave-triggered PETH of cortical firing exhibited differ-
ent features (Fig. 4C,D): Although there was still a transient in-
crease at the time of the sharp wave event (albeit not as strong as
during delta/slow oscillations), no “fast” dip was observed pre-
ceding sharp waves. Instead, an exponential decline in average
activity was observed preceding the sharp wave, with a time con-
stant of the order of seconds. Baseline firing resumed shortly after
sharp waves. Conversely, the generation of SPW events was af-
fected by the neocortical state (Fig. 4E): the frequency of sharp
wave occurrence was higher during “down-states” (1.12 (cid:1) 0.22
(cid:2)6) than during “up-states” (0.77 (cid:1) 0.20 Hz). The
Hz; p < 10
“down/up” transition-centered PETH of SPW events also revealed

Sharp waves and cortical “up-state” transitions

tween neocortical firing and sharp waves in the entorhinal cor-
tex, which are tightly related to the hippocampal ones (Chrobak
and Buzsaki 1996), because of their smaller sample size. The ef-
fect was nevertheless observed in a large fraction of the cells, thus
it could not be attributed to a modulation of a small subset of
cells (Fig. 5). These two facts taken together suggest that differ-
ent, relatively small, groups of cells are recruited by each sharp
wave episode. The small size of this group may reflect the sparse
coding of information in neocortical modules, and may be partly
caused by the high inhibitory pressure in the entorhinal cortex
(Pelletier et al. 2004). The correlation between hippocampal and
neocortical dynamics was also evident when the change in sharp
wave frequency associated with cortical activity states was con-
sidered: sharp wave events were 20%–30% more likely in corre-
spondence with down-to-up transitions compared with baseline
(Fig. 4E). Sharp waves were also more likely during down-states
than during up-states.

The intracellular physiology literature has introduced the
concept of “up” and “down” states as membrane potential fluc-
tuations between two well-defined levels. In fact, in some regions
or experimental conditions, the membrane potential fluctua-
tions are bimodal in nature (e.g., as observed in the striatum by
Wilson and Groves 1981). Bimodal fluctuations of membrane
potential have been observed in intracellular recordings in anes-
thetized and naturally sleeping animals (Timofeev et al. 2001;
Petersen et al. 2003) in the delta range, with frequencies corre-
sponding to those of the population firing rate oscillations
shown here. The picture emerging from population firing rates is,
however, somewhat different: The population firing rate during
delta/slow oscillations did not show bimodality, as the oscilla-
tions are characterized by an abrupt upward transition and a
slower decline (see, e.g., Fig. 2). This might be owing to a gradual
loss in coherence across neocortical cells (perhaps because of dif-
ferent durations of up-states in different neocortical networks) or
to firing rate adaptation, which may slow down cell firing as the
cortex remains in an up-state. Nevertheless, the data are consis-
tent with the conclusion that sharp waves were correlated with
discrete transitions from relatively low to relatively high states of
activity. The precise shape of the sharp-wave-triggered PETH de-
pends on the current dynamical state of the neocortex: During
delta/slow oscillations, the PETH stays at baseline until few hun-
dreds of milliseconds from the sharp wave, whereas, following
the sharp waves, it decays back to baseline in a few seconds,
starting from a more elevated value. In periods without delta/
slow oscillations, the PETH is basically flat after the sharp wave,
but exhibits a slowly increasing depression leading to up the
sharp wave (2–3 sec).

One possible scenario that would produce this pattern is
depicted in Figure 6. In this oversimplified scheme, transitions
between up-states and down-states are described by a Markov
process, so that the state durations follow an exponential distri-
bution, and at least a fraction of the sharp waves coincide with
the down-to-up transitions, the others being distributed ran-
domly in time. If the up-state has a much shorter mean duration
than the down-state, the sharp wave-triggered PETH of cortical
activity has a shape similar to that observed during delta oscilla-
tions. If down-states are shorter than up-states, the PETH re-
sembles that observed in no-delta/slow periods. Thus, whereas
the abrupt increase in firing at the time of the sharp wave event
is observed in both cases (in the model, because of the assump-
tion of coincidence of sharp waves and down/up transitions), the
difference in the shape of the PETH in these two dynamical re-
gimes appears to reflect a different relative duration of up- and
down-states, as might be expected in deeper or more superficial
sleep stages, possibly because of cholinergic modulation of leak-
age K+ conductances (Compte et al. 2003).

cells with firing rates that were significantly (p < 0.05) up-modulated
(white bars) or down-modulated (black bars) in intervals centered on, or
surrounding, the SPWs, as they were detected by the thresholding algo-
rithm during the periods of identified global delta/slow cortical oscilla-
tions. The firing rates in 500-msec intervals spanning from 1500 to 1000
msec before the SPW (first pair of bars), from 700 to 200 msec before the
SPW (second pair), the 500 msec after the SPW (fourth pair) and in the
intervals between the beginnings and ends of SPWs (third pair), were
compared with intervals of the same length starting 10 sec after each
SPW. A large percentage of cells was up-modulated at the time of SPWs
and 500 msec thereafter. At the time of the SPW, the number of down-
modulated cells was actually significantly lower than the chance value of
2.5%. In the intervals before the SPW there were similar proportions of
up-modulated and down-modulated cells. (B) Same comparison for the
periods of time without global delta/slow oscillations. A large percentage
of cells was down-modulated before the SPWs. A large proportion of cells
was up-modulated at the time of the SPW, whereas similar proportions of
cells were up- and down-modulated in the +500-msec interval. The
dashed line here and in A represents the 2.5% chance level. A fraction of
modulated cells close to that chance level would be attained if there were
no statistical relationship between sharp waves and cortical firing, as in
that case the intervals considered and the controls 10 sec later could be
considered random time intervals with respect to the cortical firing (*:
fraction of modulated cells different from chance level; p < 0.00001). (C)
Schematic representation of the intervals used for the comparisons in A.
The intervals used for the (cid:2)1000 msec (500 msec), (cid:2)200 msec (500

msec (500 sec), and the corresponding control intervals are displayed.

tion that extends previously published results (Destexhe et al.
1999), of the existence of longer time-scale fluctuations in
nonanesthetized animals, and, most importantly, of the relation-
ship between these cortical phenomena and hippocampal sharp
waves. A coupling between cortical delta rhythm and sharp
waves was previously demonstrated by Sirota et al. (2003) in so-
matosensory cortex. It is shown here that longer time-scale co-
herent fluctuations in cortical activity, namely, the transitions
between what have been referred to as “down-states” and “up-
states” were correlated with an increased probability of occur-
rence of sharp waves in the hippocampus (Fig. 4E), and sharp
waves were more likely to occur during down-states than during
up-states. Because the coupling between cortical activity and hip-
pocampal activity is of a probabilistic nature, there was no one-
to-one correspondence between cortical transitions and sharp
waves, which explains why the modulation observed in the
PETHs is relatively small. The small size of the effect may have
prevented Pelletier et al. (2004) from observing a relation be-

The numbers of cells whose rates were modulated up and down (p < 0.05, two-tailed t-test) and the fractions of the total are shown for each of the three
experimental animals and for the totals. The p-values are relative to the significance of the difference between the measured fraction of modulated cells
and the chance level of 2.5% (binomial, z-test).

At present, there is no clear evidence for a causal relation-
ship between these phenomena, even though a modulation in
the neocortical EEG has been shown to precede sharp wave
events by 50–100 msec (Sirota et al. 2003). Subtle changes in
neocortical input, related to the slow fluctuations, may affect the
probability of triggering an SPW in the hippocampus. More spe-
cifically, a decrease in cortical input might lead to hyperpolar-
ization and low spike rates of CA3 cells, and to a de-inactivation
of Ca++ channels (Buzsaki et al. 1992), leading to higher excit-
ability of the hippocampal neurons. A sharp wave event may
then be triggered by some fluctuation in the hippocampal input
(e.g., by a neocortical transition to an up-state). On the other
hand, it has been observed (Lewis and O’Donnell 2000) that
stimulation of hippocampus or the ventral tegmental area can
trigger up-states. Thus, the appropriate framework to describe the
hippocampal/neocortical interactions might well be that of a
closed loop, with causal relationships actually going both ways.
During down-states, the cortex may have a role in mediating the
increase in excitability in the hippocampus, which may lead to
sharp waves, which could explain the increased sharp wave fre-
quency during down-states. The burst discharge associated to a
sharp wave in the CA3 network may converge on a stored
memory state, making that memorized information available to
the neocortex (Shen and McNaughton 1996). Both the neocor-
tex, especially at the end of a down-state (Compte et al. 2003),
and the hippocampus are in an extremely excitable state, prone
to explode in coherent, self-sustained activations. Therefore,
they can readily follow the input coming from the other struc-
ture: The hippocampal drive during a sharp wave could increase
the probability of a transition from a down-state to an up-state.
Conversely, as mentioned above, the neocortical down/up tran-
sition may provide the triggering input causing the sharp wave.
Common inputs from other brain structures may influence the
generation of these related events in the hippocampus and neo-
cortex.

The set of network relationships highlighted in the present
study might be relevant to the memory consolidation process:
Sharp waves, reflecting the stored patterns of hippocampal activ-

ity (Kudrimoti et al. 1999), could elicit coordinated retrieval of
corresponding activity configurations stored in the neocortex
that are indexed by the hippocampal cue (for review, see Mc-

Figure 6 Qualitative picture of the interaction between up-state and
down-state transitions in cortical firing and hippocampal sharp waves
and how the apparently gradual trends in the average PETH functions
shown in Figure 4 can be accounted for by averaging over fluctuations in
discrete states with variable durations. In these numerical simulations, the
cortical state transitions occur randomly, according to a two-state
Markov process, whose parameters represent the mean life of each state,
and cortical firing rates are assumed to be constant within a given state.
(A) In this situation, the mean life of the up-states is much shorter (3 sec)
than the mean duration of the down-states (20 sec). If at least some
proportion of the SPW occurs in correspondence with the down-to-up
transition, the SPW-triggered PETH of cortical firing would look like the
one in B, which resembles what is observed during the periods domi-
nated by delta/slow oscillations, at least in terms of the long time scale
behavior (long decline after the SPW, mostly flat before; see Fig. 4). (C) In
the scenario in which the down-state is much shorter (3 sec) than the
up-state (20 sec), the SPW-triggered, cortical PETH would look like the
one in D, which is reminiscent of what is observed in the periods without
delta/slow oscillations (long-lasting exponential trough leading to the
SPWs, small modulation after the SPWs). The calibration bar in A and C
represents 20 sec.

ence the memory content retrieved by the hippocampus at that
time.

Materials and Methods

Electrode array and surgical procedures
The animals were treated according to NIH guidelines and ap-
proved IACUC protocols. Rats were anesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital (40 mg/kg), and a square craniotomy was opened
to accommodate the 8-mm square, 12 (cid:3) 12 guide cannulae array
(Hoffman and McNaughton 2002). The dura was left intact, and
the array was isolated from the dura surface by a layer of biocom-
patible silastic (Dow Corning). The coordinates were bregma AP
+2.6 mm (anterior side), AP (cid:2)5.2 mm (back), DL (cid:2)2.4 mm (left),
DL +5.4 mm (right) (Fig. 1A). The cannulae contained 75-µm
stainless steel electrodes, tapered to a fine tip (FHC). The unin-
sulated rear part of the electrodes made electrical contact with
the cannulae, which, in turn, were connected to a circuit board
that provided the connections between the cannulae and the
buffer preamplifiers (Neuralynx). The implant was anchored to
the skull with jeweler’s screws and dental cement. After surgery,
the electrodes were pushed through the insulation layer and the
dura to the brain surface by means of a 0.006-inch wire push-rod,
connected to a digital micromanipulator, which was inserted in
the top end of the cannulae. Once every few recording sessions,
a subset of the electrodes was advanced to new locations, search-
ing for new units in the neocortex, while a custom-written pro-
gram kept track of the depth of the electrodes. A few electrodes
were advanced to the CA1 pyramidal layer for LFP recording.

Electrophysiological recording procedures
For single unit recordings, the signal coming from the buffer
preamplifiers was differentially amplified, referred to an elec-
trode in a quiet location in the white matter, and band-pass
filtered between 600 Hz and 6 kHz. Whenever the signal ex-
ceeded a threshold, a spike waveform was acquired at 25 kHz
(duration 1.3 msec) and recorded on the hard disk (Cheetah re-
cording system; Neuralynx, Inc.). LFPs were filtered between 1 Hz
and 475 Hz and continuously recorded at 1.6 kHz. The acquired
waveforms were sorted off-line using a semiautomated clustering
algorithm (BBClust, P. Lipa, unpubl.) based on the waveform
amplitude, and the wave-shape principal components, and suc-
cessively refined manually with custom-written software
(MClust, A.D. Redish, unpubl.).

Recording session protocol
For rats 1 and 2, during each recording session, rats were allowed
to rest and/or sleep for two sessions of 25/40 min, while electro-
physiological data were recorded. In between these sessions, the
rats ran for food back and forth on a circular track. The two
reward sites were separated by a barrier so that the rat had to
alternate directions on the track. Along the track, many multi-
modal sensory cues were placed: odors, floor coverings with dif-
ferent textures, rods that hit the whiskers while the rat was pass-
ing by, and an earphone playing music. Only the data from the
rest sessions were used for this work. Rat 3 was allowed to rest
and/or sleep for 25/40 min during electrophysiological record-
ings, and did not perform any behavioral task.

Up-state detection
For this analysis, only 28 sessions with 40 or more recorded cells
were considered. Spike-trains were binned in 1-sec intervals. For
each interval, the number of active cells (i.e., cells that fired at
least one spike in the interval) was computed. If that number
exceeded a threshold, an up-state was detected. The threshold
was computed as the 95th percentile of the distribution, com-
puted from randomly and independently shuffled spike trains.
The threshold was therefore a value representative of the ex-
pected amount of fluctuation in the total activity in spike trains

Sharp waves and cortical “up-state” transitions

with similar firing rates, but in which the coherence across cells
was disrupted.

Sharp wave detection
The CA1 pyramidal layer LFP was filtered in the ripple oscillation
frequency domain (100–300 Hz). SPW events were detected by
means of a thresholding algorithm. Suprathreshold events closer
to each other than 100 msec were merged, and events shorter
than 50 msec were discarded. For neocortical activity PETH cal-
culations, SPW timestamps were computed as the times of the
highest peaks in the ripple oscillation within the SPW events.

Spectral analysis of cortical activity
The combined spike train from all the recorded cortical cells in
each session was transformed into a time series by a 5-msec time
window binning. The power spectrum of the resulting time series
was estimated by means of multitaper analysis (Mitra and Pesa-
ran 1999; Percival and Walden 2002), in a sliding time window
with a width of ∼10 sec. The aggregate power in the 0.8– 4 Hz as
a function of time was used as an index of oscillatory activity in
the delta/slow range. Epochs in which this index exceeded a
manually defined threshold area are considered as delta/slow os-
cillation periods.
