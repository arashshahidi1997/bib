Abstract
The sleeping neocortex shows nested oscillatory activity in different
                     frequency ranges, characterized by fluctuations between
                     “up-states” and “down-states.” High-density neuronal
                     ensemble recordings in rats now reveal the interaction between synchronized
                     activity in the hippocampus and neocortex: Electroencephalographic sharp waves
                     in the hippocampus were more probable during down-states than during
                     up-states, and tended to coincide with transitions from down-states to
                     up-states. The form of cortical activity fluctuations and their interactions
                     with sharp waves depend on sleep depth: In deeper sleep stages, characterized
                     by strong neocortical oscillation in the delta range or slower (∼0.8-4
                     Hz), sharp-wave-triggered peri-event time histograms (PETH) are consistent
                     with a longer duration for down-states than for up-states. In lighter sleep,
                     the sharp-wave-triggered PETH suggested longer up-states than down-states.
                     These results highlight the interplay in the hippocampal/neocortical loop:
                     Decreased neocortical input during down-states may be a factor in generation
                     of sharp waves. In turn, sharp waves may facilitate down-to-up transitions.
                     This interplay may reflect joint memory trace reactivation in the hippocampus
                     and in the neocortex, possibly contributing to consolidation of long-term
                     memory: Off-line reactivation of recent neural activity patterns in the
                     hippocampus occurs during 50-100-msec electroencephalographic sharp waves,
                     corresponding to pyramidal-cell population bursts. The neocortical up-states
                     starting in correspondence with sharp waves may be influenced by the
                     reactivated information carried by the hippocampal sharp wave.
