Note that the time-course of the activation is not related to the stimulation (0 ms). It is also hard to interpret the observed spatial pattern in physiological terms. (B) Spatial ICA, α = 1. The spatial component has a clear, physiologically meaningful organization (localized activity in VPM). Before stimulation this component is not active. Two waves of activation (4–6 ms and 20–30 ms) may be interpreted as incoming sensory activation and the activation of cortico-thalamic feedback, respectively. The spatial profiles are shown at times of maximum of the temporal counterparts, vertical lines in the lower panels of (A), (B)",
