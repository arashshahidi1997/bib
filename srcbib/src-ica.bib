  abstract = {Ongoing network activity often manifests as irregular fluctuations in local field potentials (LFPs), a complex mixture of multicellular synaptic currents of varying locations and extensions. Among other conditions, for synchronously firing presynaptic units to generate sizable postsynaptic LFPs, their axonal territories should overlap. We have taken advantage of anatomical regularity of the rat hippocampus and combined multiple linear recordings and spatial discrimination techniques to separate pathway-specific LFPs with enough spatial resolution to discriminate postsynaptic regions of varying activation, and to investigate their presynaptic origin, chemical nature, and spatial extension. We identified 6 main excitatory and inhibitory LFP generators with different synaptic territories in principal cells and hippocampal subfields matching anatomical pathways. Some recognized pathways did not contribute notably to LFPs. Each showed different septo-temporal spatial modules over which the field potential fluctuations were synchronous. These modules were explained by either the strong overlap of synaptic territories of coactivated afferent neurons (e.g., CA3 clusters for CA1 Schaffer LFPs), or widespread coalescence of postsynaptic territories (granule cell somatic inhibition). We also show evidence that distinct modes of afferent synchronization generate stereotyped spatial patterns of synchronous LFPs in one pathway. Thus, studying spatial coherence of pathway-specific LFPs provides remote access to the dynamics of afferent populations.},

  abstract = {Although intracerebral field potential oscillations are commonly used to study information processing during cognition and behavior, the cellular and network processes underlying such events remain unclear. The limited spatial resolution of standard single-point recordings does not clarify whether field oscillations reflect the activity of one or many afferent presynaptic populations. However, multi-site recording devices now provide high-resolution spatial profiles of local field potentials and when coupled to modern mathematical analyses that discriminate signals with distinct but overlapping spatial distributions, they open the door to better understand these potentials. Here we review recent insights that help disentangle certain pathway-specific activities. Accordingly, some oscillatory patterns can now be viewed as a periodic succession of synchronous synaptic currents that reflect the time envelope of spiking activity in given presynaptic populations. These analyses modify our concept of brain rhythms as abstract entities, molding them into mechanistic representations of network activity and allowing us to work in the time domain, reducing the loss of information inherent to data-chopping frequency treatment.},

  abstract = {Local field potentials have good temporal resolution but are blurred due to the slow spatial decay of the electric field. For simultaneous recordings on regular grids one can reconstruct efficiently the current sources (CSD) using the inverse Current Source Density method (iCSD). It is possible to decompose the resultant spatiotemporal information about the current dynamics into functional components using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). We show on test data modeling recordings of evoked potentials on a grid of 4\texttimes 5\texttimes 7 points that meaningful results are obtained with spatial ICA decomposition of reconstructed CSD. The components obtained through decomposition of CSD are better defined and allow easier physiological interpretation than the results of similar analysis of corresponding evoked potentials in the thalamus. We show that spatiotemporal ICA decompositions can perform better for certain types of sources but it does not seem to be the case for the experimental data studied. Having found the appropriate approach to decomposing neural dynamics into functional components we use the technique to study the somatosensory evoked potentials recorded on a grid spanning a large part of the forebrain. We discuss two example components associated with the first waves of activation of the somatosensory thalamus. We show that the proposed method brings up new, more detailed information on the time and spatial location of specific activity conveyed through various parts of the somatosensory thalamus in the rat.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal firing is organized in theta sequences controlled by internal memory processes and by external sensory cues, but how these computations are coordinated is not fully understood. Although theta activity is commonly studied as a unique coherent oscillation, it is the result of complex interactions between different rhythm generators. Here, by separating hippocampal theta activity in three different current generators, we found epochs with variable theta frequency and phase coupling, suggesting flexible interactions between theta generators. We found that epochs of highly synchronized theta rhythmicity preferentially occurred during behavioral tasks requiring coordination between internal memory representations and incoming sensory information. In addition, we found that gamma oscillations were associated with specific theta generators and the strength of theta-gamma coupling predicted the synchronization between theta generators. We propose a mechanism for segregating or integrating hippocampal computations based on the flexible coordination of different theta frameworks to accommodate the cognitive needs.},

  abstract = {Theta oscillations organize neuronal firing in the hippocampus during context exploration and memory formation. Recently, we have shown that multiple theta rhythms coexist in the hippocampus, reflecting the activity in their afferent regions in CA3 (Schaffer collaterals) and the entorhinal cortex layers II (EC-II, perforant pathway) and III (EC-III, temporoammonic pathway). Frequency and phase coupling between theta rhythms were modulated by the behavioral state, with synchronized theta rhythmicity preferentially occurring in tasks involving memory updating. However, information transmission between theta generators was not investigated. Here, we used source separation techniques to disentangle the current generators recorded in the hippocampus of rats exploring a known environment with or without a novel stimulus. We applied analytical tools based on Granger causality and transfer entropy to investigate linear and non-linear directed interactions, respectively, between the theta activities. Exploration in the novelty condition was associated with increased theta power in the generators with EC origin. We found a significant directed interaction from the Schaffer input over the EC-III input in CA1, and a bidirectional interaction between the inputs in the hippocampus originating in the EC, likely reflecting the connection between layers II and III. During novelty exploration, the influence of the EC-II over the EC-III generator increased, while the Schaffer influence decreased. These results associate the increase in hippocampal theta activity and synchrony during novelty exploration with an increase in the directed functional connectivity from EC-II to EC-III.},
