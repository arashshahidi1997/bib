# Bibliography
This folder contains bibliography files for the Pixecog project documentation and manuscript.

`pixecog.bib` is the main BibTeX file used across the documentation and manuscript sources. It includes references cited in various Markdown files throughout the `docs/` folder as well as in the manuscript drafts located in `docs/manuscript/`.

# Using Citations
When adding citations in Markdown files, use the standard citation syntax supported by Foam and Pandoc, e.g., `[@doe2020study]`, where `doe2020study` corresponds to the citation key in `pixecog.bib`.


# Setup Instructions
To add new references, do not edit this file directly. Instead, use a reference manager like Zotero or Mendeley to manage your citations and export the updated BibTeX file here under `metadata` subdirectory.

`src-<name>-pixecog.bib`

## On Your Local Machine
you can export it in a local clone of the `pixecog` repository in a `keep updated` bibtex format.

By running the `code/fetch.py` script, you can automatically fetch and update these source bibliography files from their respective online repositories. This ensures that your references remain current and accurate.

And then datalad push --to origin and update here.

## On the Server
The `pixecog.bib` file is updated by running the `code/merge.py` script, which merges all source bibliography files from the `metadata/` subdirectory.
