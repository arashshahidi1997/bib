  abstract = {The sleeping neocortex shows nested oscillatory activity in different frequency ranges, characterized by fluctuations between ``up-states'' and ``down-states.'' High-density neuronal ensemble recordings in rats now reveal the interaction between synchronized activity in the hippocampus and neocortex: Electroencephalographic sharp waves in the hippocampus were more probable during down-states than during up-states, and tended to coincide with transitions from down-states to up-states. The form of cortical activity fluctuations and their interactions with sharp waves depend on sleep depth: In deeper sleep stages, characterized by strong neocortical oscillation in the delta range or slower ({$\sim$}0.8-4 Hz), sharp-wave-triggered peri-event time histograms (PETH) are consistent with a longer duration for down-states than for up-states. In lighter sleep, the sharp-wave-triggered PETH suggested longer up-states than down-states. These results highlight the interplay in the hippocampal/neocortical loop: Decreased neocortical input during down-states may be a factor in generation of sharp waves. In turn, sharp waves may facilitate down-to-up transitions. This interplay may reflect joint memory trace reactivation in the hippocampus and in the neocortex, possibly contributing to consolidation of long-term memory: Off-line reactivation of recent neural activity patterns in the hippocampus occurs during 50-100-msec electroencephalographic sharp waves, corresponding to pyramidal-cell population bursts. The neocortical up-states starting in correspondence with sharp waves may be influenced by the reactivated information carried by the hippocampal sharp wave.},

In anesthetized rats, we find that neocortical "slow" oscillation engages neurons in prefrontal, somatosensory, entorhinal, and subicular cortices into synchronous transitions between UP and DOWN states, with a corresponding bimodal distribution of their membrane potential. The membrane potential of hippocampal granule cells and CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells lacked bimodality, yet it was influenced by the slow oscillation in a region-specific manner. Furthermore, in both anesthetized and naturally sleeping rats, the cortical UP states resulted in increased activity of dentate and most CA1 neurons, as well as the highest probability of ripple events. Yet, the CA3-CA1 network could self-organize into gamma bursts and occasional ripples during the DOWN state. Thus, neo/paleocortical and hippocampal networks periodically reset, self-organize, and temporally coordinate their cell assemblies via the slow oscillation.},

Yet, the spatial and temporal patterns of this interaction are unknown. With voltage imaging, electrocorticography, and laminarly resolved hippocampal potentials, we characterized cortico-hippocampal signaling during anesthesia and nonrapid eye movement sleep. We observed neocortical activation transients, with statistics suggesting a quasi-critical regime, may be helpful for communication across remote brain areas. From activity transients, we identified, in a data-driven fashion, three functional networks. A network overlapping with the default mode network and centered on retrosplenial cortex was the most associated with hippocampal activity. Hippocampal slow gamma rhythms were strongly associated to neocortical transients, even more than ripples. In fact, neocortical activity predicted hippocampal slow gamma and followed ripples, suggesting that consolidation processes rely on bidirectional signaling between hippocampus and neocortex.},

  abstract = {During NREM sleep, hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are thought to stabilize memory traces for long-term storage in downstream neocortical structures. Within the neocortex, a set of distributed networks organized around retrosplenial cortex (RS-network) interact preferentially with the hippocampus purportedly to consolidate those traces. Transient bouts of slow oscillations and sleep spindles in this RS-network are often observed around SWRs, suggesting that these two activities are related and that their interplay possibly contributes to memory consolidation. To investigate how SWRs interact with the RS-network and spindles, we combined cortical wide-field voltage imaging, Electrocorticography, and hippocampal LFP recordings in anesthetized and sleeping mice. Here, we show that, during SWR, ``up-states'' and spindles reliably co-occur in a cortical subnetwork centered around the retrosplenial cortex. Furthermore, retrosplenial transient activations and spindles predict slow gamma oscillations in CA1 during SWRs. Together, our results suggest that retrosplenial--hippocampal interaction may be a critical pathway of information exchange between the cortex and hippocampus.},

  abstract = {During light slow-wave sleep, the thalamo-cortical network oscillates in waxing-and-waning patterns at about 7 to 14 Hz and lasting for 500 ms to 3 s, called spindles, with the thalamus rhythmically sending strong excitatory volleys to the cortex. Concurrently, the hippocampal activity is characterized by transient and strong excitatory events, Sharp-Waves-Ripples (SPWRs), directly affecting neocortical activity---in particular the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)---which receives monosynaptic fibers from the ventral hippocampus and subiculum. Both spindles and SPWRs have been shown to be strongly involved in memory consolidation. However, the dynamics of the cortical network during natural sleep spindles and how prefrontal circuits simultaneously process hippocampal and thalamo-cortical activity remain largely undetermined. Using multisite neuronal recordings in rat mPFC, we show that during sleep spindles, oscillatory responses of cortical cells are different for different cell types and cortical layers. Superficial neurons are more phase-locked and tonically recruited during spindle episodes. Moreover, in a given layer, interneurons were always more modulated than pyramidal cells, both in firing rate and phase, suggesting that the dynamics are dominated by inhibition. In the deep layers, where most of the hippocampal fibers make contacts, pyramidal cells respond phasically to SPWRs, but not during spindles. Similar observations were obtained when analyzing {$\gamma$}-oscillation modulation in the mPFC. These results demonstrate that during sleep spindles, the cortex is functionnaly ``deafferented'' from its hippocampal inputs, based on processes of cortical origin, and presumably mediated by the strong recruitment of inhibitory interneurons. The interplay between hippocampal and thalamic inputs may underlie a global mechanism involved in the consolidation of recently formed memory traces.},

Neuronal bursts in deep cortical layers, associated with sleep spindles and delta waves/slow rhythm, effectively triggered hippocampal discharges related to fast (ripple) oscillations.

By combining electrophysiology in mouse hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) with wide-field imaging of the dorsal neocortex, we found spatially and temporally precise bi-directional hippocampo-neocortical interaction. HPC multi-unit activity and SWR probability were correlated with UP/DOWN states in the default mode network (DMN), with the highest modulation by the RSC in deep sleep. Further, some SWRs were preceded by the high rebound excitation accompanying DMN DOWN / UP transitions, whereas large-amplitude SWRs were often followed by DOWN states originating in the RSC. We explain these electrophysiological results with a model in which the HPC and RSC are weakly coupled excitable systems capable of bi-directional perturbation and suggest that the RSC may act as a gateway through which SWRs can perturb downstream cortical regions via cortico-cortical propagation of DOWN states.},

However, spike-timing relationships across cortico-hippocampal networks---key determinants of synaptic changes---are poorly understood. Here we show that cells in prefrontal cortex fire consistently within 100 ms after hippocampal cells in naturally sleeping animals. This provides evidence at the single cell-pair level for highly consistent directional interactions between these areas within the window of plasticity. Moreover, these interactions are state dependent: they are driven by hippocampal sharp-wave/ripple (SWR) bursts in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and are sharply reduced during REM sleep. Finally, prefrontal responses are nonlinear: as the strength of hippocampal bursts rises, short-latency prefrontal responses are augmented by increased spindle band activity and a secondary peak {$\sim$}100 ms later. These findings suggest that SWR events are atomic units of hippocampal-prefrontal communication during SWS and that the coupling between these areas is highly attenuated during REM sleep.},
